remains a significant threat to global health , and results in 200 , 000 hospitalizations and 3 , 000–49 , 000 deaths each year in the United States [1]–[3] .', 'The ability of influenza virus to rapidly mutate and/or undergo reassortment , allows the virus to evade protective immunity obtained from previous infections or vaccinations [4] .', 'Annual influenza vaccines induce an antibody response specific for the highly variable surface glycoproteins of influenza: neuraminidase ( NA ) and hemagglutinin ( HA ) .', 'These seasonal vaccines typically take months to produce and rely on the accurate prediction of the influenza serotypes that will be circulating in the next flu season [5] .', 'Thus , if the prediction is not accurate or a pandemic strain emerges , current vaccines offer little protection .', 'Much research has therefore , focused on the development of a “universal” vaccine that will target the conserved , internal regions of the influenza virus , and confer protection against multiple influenza virus serotypes .', 'Significant research in the influenza field has focused on the design of vaccines capable of eliciting influenza virus-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes [6]–[8] .', 'Since , CD8+ T cells are able to recognize internal , conserved regions of the influenza virus , these cells may be able provide cross-subtype , or heterosubtypic , protection against the influenza virus [9]–[13] .', 'A large body of work supports the potential viability of a CD8+ T-cell based vaccine [14]–[17] .', 'In mice , vaccination with internal proteins such as influenza nucleoprotein ( NP ) , leads to higher frequencies of NP-specific CD8+ T cells prior to infection , and lower viral titers after challenge with H1N1 and H3N2 strains of influenza [18]–[22] .', 'Furthermore , influenza virus-specific memory T cells are detected in the peripheral blood of healthy adolescents and adults , and there is some evidence for heterosubtypic immunity in humans that has been proposed to be due to T cells [23]–[25] .', 'However , several groups have reported that the number of influenza virus-specific memory CD8+ T cells in the lung airways of mice declines over time corresponding with a loss of heterosubtypic protection [26]–[29] .', 'While there is some conflicting data over whether heterosubtypic protection wanes , if true this gradual loss of the virus-specific CD8+ T cell population represents a serious concern in the generation of CD8+ T cell based vaccines [30] .', 'Interestingly , recent work suggests that non-neutralizing antibodies targeting the internal proteins of influenza , specifically NP , can provide some protection against the influenza virus infection through a mechanism involving Fc receptors [31]–[34] .', 'Unlike neutralizing antibodies , which are able to prevent viral entry or exit , non-neutralizing antibodies typically target antigens that reside inside virions and/or infected cells .', 'Despite recent progress , it is still not clear what role T cells play in non neutralizing antibody-mediated heterosubtypic protection elicited in an immune competent host .', 'Additionally the mechanisms by which non-neutralizing antibodies can provide protection against the influenza virus remain elusive .', 'Several groups have also noted the potential role of CD4+ T cells in providing protection against influenza virus [6] , [35] , [36] .', 'These reports indicated that CD4+ T cells can form a lung-resident population following influenza virus infection where they can serve a protective role in mediating enhanced viral clearance and survival following lethal challenge through a variety of mechanisms including IFNγ secretion [35] , [37] .', 'Recent studies using human volunteers infected with influenza virus also point to a key role for pre-existing CD4 T cell responses in limiting the severity of influenza virus infection and disease [38] .', 'Intriguingly , influenza-specific memory CD4+ T cells have also been reported to synergize with naïve B cells and CD8+ T cells to provide protection against influenza viral infection [36] .', 'Whether virus-specific CD8 T cells also exhibit such cooperativity in protective immunity is unclear .', 'In this study , we demonstrate that , in most settings , influenza virus-specific CD8+ T cells alone are insufficient to provide optimal protection against influenza virus .', 'However , when virus-specific non-neutralizing antibodies are present together with virus-specific CD8+ T cells , complete protection is achieved against a lethal influenza virus challenge .', 'Moreover , this cooperative protection is dependent , at least in part , on the presence of alveolar macrophages ( AM ) or other respiratory tract phagocytes , suggesting that non-neutralizing antibodies are able to eliminate influenza virus-infected cells through antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) and/or phagocytosis .', 'We demonstrate a novel mechanism by which antibodies and CD8+ T cells targeted against the conserved regions of the influenza virus act in concert to provide heterosubtypic protection .', 'Our results complement recent work on the synergy between memory CD4+ T cells and naïve B and CD8 T cells [36] and suggest that elicitating multiple arms of the adaptive immune response may represent a potent mechanism by which heterosubtypic protection against the influenza virus can be achieved .'], ['It has been reported that CD8+ T cell activity correlates with reduced influenza virus shedding following rechallenge [13] .', 'Since , CD8+ T cell epitopes are often located in the internal , conserved regions of the influenza virus , the generation of influenza virus-specific CD8+ T cells may provide protective immunity against heterosubtypic influenza strains .', 'Thus , we tested whether influenza virus-specific CD8+ T cells could mediate protective immunity using a recombinant viral approach to identify and track responses .', 'We used influenza viruses in which the GP33-41 epitope from lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus ( LCMV ) , was inserted into the NA stalk region of the H3N2 influenza X31 ( X31-GP33 ) and H1N1 influenza PR8 ( PR8-GP33 ) viruses [39] , [40] .', 'Influenza viruses expressing the GP33 epitope have been shown to induce a robust GP33 response in mice [39] , [41] .', 'Mice were primed with either LCMV Armstrong or X31-GP33 intranasally ( i . n . ) and rechallenged , along with a control group of naïve mice , with PR8-GP33 30 days later .', 'The antibodies generated against the surface glycoproteins of the H3N2 X31-GP33 virus do not neutralize the H1N1 PR8-GP33 challenge virus [42]–[44] .', 'The GP33-specific CD8+ T cell population elicited from primary viral challenge , however , should be capable of responding to the secondary infection , allowing the role of CD8+ T cells in protection against the influenza virus to be investigated .', 'The level of protection conferred upon secondary challenge was determined using three assays .', 'Morbidity was assessed by weight loss .', 'Pulse oximetry was also used to evaluate lung function .', 'Finally , real time quantitative ( qRT-PCR ) was used to detect viral RNA and determine viral load at several time points following infection .', 'X31-GP33 primed mice were completely protected from influenza rechallenge by all 3 measures ( Fig . 1A ) .', 'These mice experienced almost no impairment of lung function or loss in weight , and had low viral load at all time points measured .', 'In contrast , the LCMV Armstrong immunized mice , despite generating a robust GP33-specific CD8+ T cell response , exhibited little if any protection from the PR8-GP33 rechallenge .', 'Apart from a slight delay in compromised lung function , the LCMV Armstrong immune mice were indistinguishable from the naïve group and experienced a 25% decline in weight and lung function by day 9 post rechallenge .', 'To determine if the difference in protection between the X31-GP33 and LCMV Armstrong immune groups was due to the X31-GP33 immune mice having a larger influenza virus-specific CD8+ T cell response , we quantified the total immune response in these mice 6 days after rechallenge in the lung , bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) , and spleen .', 'Responses were analyzed using intracellular staining to evaluate the number of cells in these mice able to produce interferon gamma ( IFNγ ) in response to stimulation with overlapping peptide pools for the influenza virus proteins HA , NA , non-structural protein 1 ( NS1 ) , NS2 , polymerase acidic ( PA ) , polymerase basic ( PB ) , NP , as well as the LCMV GP33 peptide .', 'We found that the LCMV Armstrong immune mice had a similar or slightly larger antiviral CD8+ T cell response directed against the recombinant influenza virus following rechallenge in both the lung and BAL despite lack of protection ( Fig . 1B ) .', 'Similar results were obtained using mice immunized intraperitoneally ( i . p . ) with LCMV Armstrong ( Fig . S1A , S1B , S1C ) , though LCMV i . n . immunized mice had slightly enhanced viral control compared to the LCMV i . p . primed mice ( Fig . S2 ) .', 'Overall , while the route of priming may have some impact , these results indicate that the magnitude of the virus-specific CD8+ T cell response alone might not be a major determinate of protection against influenza viral challenge and suggest that other factors could be responsible for protection against influenza virus in X31-GP33 immune mice .', 'We first sought to evaluate whether the agent used to prime the mice could have an impact on protection in our system .', 'The specific priming agent used has been reported to confer differences in protection against influenza virus in several vaccine studies [45] , [46] .', 'Thus , mice were primed with LCMV Armstrong , Listeria-GP33 ( LM-GP33 ) , or Vaccinia-GP33 .', 'Each group of mice had a similar GP33-specific CD8+ T cell population despite being immunized with different bacterial or viral agents .', 'We found that regardless of the priming agent used , all groups experienced severe weight loss , decline in lung function , and high viral load following rechallenge with PR8-GP33 ( data not shown ) .', 'Thus , in this setting , the priming agent did not have an obvious direct correlation with whether or not protection was achieved .', 'We next examined whether the epitope against which the CD8+ T cells were primed impacted protection .', 'Different epitopes have been shown to elicit varying levels of protection to the influenza virus [47] .', 'We therefore tested whether priming with another CD8 epitope shared between X31-GP33 and PR8-GP33 , the dominant Db-restricted NP366-374 ( NP366 ) epitope from influenza virus nucleoprotein , could elicit better protection than the GP33 response .', 'Mice were primed with recombinant viruses ( or bacteria ) expressing GP33 , NP366 , or a non-influenza determinant ( the LCMV nucleoprotein ) , and challenged 30 days later .', 'None of these approaches achieved substantial protection against PR8-GP33 rechallenge , as each group had substantial weight loss , high viral load and reduced lung function ( Fig . 2A ) .', 'Thus , at least for the determinants examined , the specific epitope was not a major factor in the lack of protection observed in this model system .', 'Next , we used a prime-boost strategy to test whether the more robust immune response induced upon boosting was superior in providing protection compared to non-boosted memory CD8+ T cells .', 'Mice were immunized with LM-GP33 and then boosted with LCMV Armstrong 30 days after initial priming .', 'These mice were then rechallenged with PR8-GP33 either 8 days or 30 days after the boost .', 'We also immunized a group of mice with LCMV Armstrong and rechallenged with PR8-GP33 8 days later .', 'The mice rechallenged with influenza virus 8 days after initial priming displayed delayed morbidity with the initiation of weight loss on ∼day 6 post rechallenge rather than at ∼day 2–3 in naïve mice ( Fig . 2B ) .', 'This transient delay in weight loss suggested that GP33-specific effector CD8+ T cell response present at 8 days after acute LCMV infection was capable of providing some initial protection following influenza virus infection .', 'This group , however , still lost significant weight by day 9 post rechallenge and had reduced lung function as well as high viral load .', 'It is worth noting that the dose of LCMV Armstrong used here has been demonstrated in our lab and others to be cleared by day 8 [48] .', 'The prime boost group that was rechallenged 30 days after the “boost” did not experience this transient delay in weight loss and showed kinetics of morbidity similar to the LCMV Armstrong immune groups described above in terms of magnitude of weight loss and decline of lung function suggesting that the greater magnitude of GP33-specific CD8+ T cell response in this group was insufficient to mediate protection .', 'In contrast , the prime-boost group that was rechallenged 8 days after the “boost” showed no signs of influenza-related pathology in terms of weight loss and lung function .', 'Despite this lack of morbidity these mice still had very high viral loads until day 9 post rechallenge ( Fig . 2B ) .', 'While priming ( and the prime-boost regimen ) was able to induce a robust population of GP33-specific response capable of producing IFNγ and tumor necrosis factor ( TNFα ) in response to stimulation ( Fig . S3 ) , this response was still insufficient to mediate viral clearance .', 'Thus , although this prime boost group is similar to the X31-GP33 group in terms of weight loss and lung function following rechallenge , viral control was relatively poor .', 'The protection from morbidity in the mice challenged 8 days after boosting was not due simply to elevated bystander inflammation as mice subjected to two other prime-boost strategies that lacked CD8+ T cells specific for influenza virus showed rapid weight loss ( Fig . 2C ) .', 'Furthermore , the lack of weight loss achieved by the virus-specific prime-boost strategy was recapitulated when LM-GP33 was substituted with VV-GP33 ( Fig . 2C ) , suggesting that the lack of weight loss in these mice is not dependent on the identity of the priming agent , but on the rapid initiation of an influenza virus-specific CD8+ T cell response .', 'These results are in line with reports that “boosted” memory CD8+ T cells are better than primary memory CD8+ T cells in controlling some acute infections [49] , [50] .', 'However , while pathology was reduced , this immune response was not sufficient to efficiently control viral load .', 'We next investigated whether we could achieve enhanced CD8+ T cell-mediated protection using adoptive transfer strategies analogous to adoptive transfer approaches used for influenza virus-specific CD4+ T cells [35] , [36] .', 'Ly5 . 1+ mice were immunized with LM-GP33 and 30 days later boosted with LCMV Armstrong .', 'On day 8 following the boost , CD8+ T cells were isolated and 0 . 8×106 , or 1 . 6×106 GP33+ CD8+ T cells were adoptively transferred to Ly5 . 2+ naïve mice .', 'The recipient mice were rechallenged with PR8-GP33 the next day .', 'Little to no protection was observed as measured by weight loss and viral load compared to a PBS-treated control group ( Fig . 3A–B ) , despite high numbers of GP33 specific CD8+ T cells present in the lungs of these mice 6 days after rechallenge ( Fig . 3C ) .', 'To determine whether the observed lack of protection was due to an insufficient number of in vivo primed adoptively transferred GP33-specific CD8+ T cells , we primed P14 TCR-transgenic CD8+ T cells ( specific for LCMV GP33-41 ) using an in vitro approach that allowed the generation of large numbers of activated GP33-specific CD8+ T cells .', 'We then adoptively transferred 2×106 , 10×106 or 20×106 GP33-specific CD8+ T cells into naïve mice and challenged these mice with influenza virus .', 'Mice given 20×106 or 10×106 GP33-specific CD8+ T cells were almost completely protected from influenza-related morbidity and experienced virtually no decline in weight or lung function ( Fig . 3D ) .', 'Additionally , even the group given 2×106 GP33-specific CD8+ T cells exhibited improved protection with only a 15% decline in weight and a 20% reduction in lung function .', 'Despite the greatly reduced morbidity in these mice , the viral loads measured by qRT-PCR for viral RNA were almost indistinguishable from the PBS-treated control group .', 'This lack of difference in viral control was confirmed using an assay for infectious virus to ensure that qRT-PCR-based approach was accurately reflecting replicating virus rather than residual viral debris or viral RNA independent of replicating virus ( Fig .

CD4 T cells ) .', 'X31-GP33 immune mice are largely protected against symptoms of influenza virus infection in the absence of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells , suggesting other possible mechanisms contributing to protection .', 'One possibility is that B cells have a role through the action of non-neutralizing antibodies specific for determinants shared between the X31 and PR8 influenza strains .', 'To test this notion , we immunized µMT mice , which lack B cells [53] , with X31-GP33 .', 'When challenged 30 days later these mice demonstrated no protection against PR8-GP33 despite a very similar influenza virus-specific CD8 T cell response compared to B6 mice ( Fig . 4B and C ) .', 'These data suggested that B cells are essential for heterosubtypic protection .', 'One concern is that the immunological response may be altered in µMT mice due to the total lack of B cells .', 'Therefore , we examined MD4 transgenic mice that have normal numbers of B cells , but have a transgenic B cell receptor specific for hen egg lysozyme [54] and are therefore unable to generate an influenza virus-specific antibody response .', 'Similar to the µMT mice , however , MD4 mice immunized with X31-GP33 were also not protected and experienced severe weight loss upon rechallenge with PR8-GP33 ( Fig . 4B ) .', 'X31-GP33 immune MD4 mice also had reduced lung function and high viral load ( Fig . 4B ) .', 'To

previous studies have demonstrated that antibodies induced by X31 do not neutralize PR8 and vice versa [42]–[44] , it was possible that a new neutralizing determinant might have been formed due to the

whether this cooperativity-based protection could be achieved using natural influenza-virus derived epitopes we immunized mice with VVNP366 to induce an influenza virus-specific T cell response .',

artifact of out recombinant influenza virus system , but rather a likely physiologically relevant mechanism of protection against influenza virus challenge .', 'The means by which non-neutralizing antibodies operate in cooperative protection is unclear .', 'Among the possible mechanisms are: antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) , Fc receptor ( FcR ) mediated phagocytosis , and the complement pathway .', 'To distinguish between these possibilities we used mice either lacking FcRγ or interleukin-15 ( IL-15 ) .', 'FcRγ -/- mice are deficient in the gamma chain subunit of the

parameters tested regardless of whether the mice were given X31-GP33 or naïve serum ( Fig . 7A ) .', 'Together , these results suggested that non-neutralizing antibody-based protection was FcRγ-dependent , but that NK cells were non-essential .', 'To further examine cooperative heterosubtypic immunity we first immunized B6 mice with X31-GP33 .', 'After 30 days we treated these mice i .

'These mice experienced severe morbidity and high viral load despite having an unimpaired CD8+ T cell response ( Fig . S5A ) .', 'All other groups remained healthy and controlled the infection ( Fig . 7B ) .', 'This result suggested that heterosubtypic immunity mediated by non-neutralizing antibodies and CD8+ T cells was , at least in part , dependent on cells depleted by clodronate liposomes including AM .', 'It is important to note that while we found clodronate liposome treatment to be non-toxic to uninfected mice and to result in ∼70% depletion of alveolar macrophages in the BAL fluid three days following a single clodronate treatment ( Fig . S5B ) , it is possible that depletion of other airway populations such as dendritic cell or inflammatory macrophages could occur .', 'The unimpaired CD8+ response seen in clodronate liposome treated mice however , suggests that any clodronate depletion of dendritic cells in the airway was insufficient to significantly impact presentation of antigen to CD8+ T cells .', 'Furthermore , preliminary studies using adoptive transfer of alveolar macrophages obtained from the BAL of naïve mice into LCMV Armstrong immune FcRγ -/- mice suggested that reintroducing alveolar macrophages could partially rescue weight loss in half the mice when given in conjunction with X31 serum ( Fig . S6 ) .', 'While further studies are necessary , these data are consistent with the notion that AM are involved in cooperative heterosubtypic protection .', 'To further evaluate the role of AM and NK cells in cooperative heterosubtypic protection , we depleted AM or NK cells in LCMV Armstrong immune mice as described above , and administered X31-GP33 serum to these mice one day prior to

a trend towards higher viral loads then the group given only X31-GP33 serum , but this difference was not significant and this group still experienced almost no weight loss or decline in lung function

indicates that the mechanism of non-neutralizing antibody-based protection is dependent on cells depleted by clodronate liposomes , including AM , likely through FcR-dependent AM phagocytosis or ADCC

vaccine by inducing CD8+ T cells specific for conserved internal proteins of influenza virus has received considerable attention , but remains an unrealized goal .', 'In this study , we demonstrate that influenza virus-specific CD8+ T cells can cooperate with non-neutralizing antibodies to provide efficient cross-subtype influenza virus-specific protection .', 'While non-neutralizing antibodies against M2e or other conserved determinants have recently been examined , our data indicate a previously unappreciated role for cooperativity between non-neutralizing antibodies and CD8+ T cell responses in the induction of optimal protection from serologically distinct influenza virus strains .', 'This mechanism represents a novel approach by which a universal influenza vaccine could be developed .', 'Currently there are several promising universal influenza vaccine candidates in development .', 'Among these candidates are broadly neutralizing antibodies , which are able to target the conserved stem region of the influenza virus [60]–[64] .', 'These broadly neutralizing antibodies have been found to be cross reactive among different H1 or H3 influenza subtypes and are likely to represent a major advance in generating more effective influenza virus vaccines .', 'However , current antibodies specific for the H1 stem are largely effective only against heterologous H1 and H5 viruses , and antibodies against the H3 stem are only effective against H3 viruses [60] .', 'Interestingly , neutralizing antibodies were sometimes induced following vaccination with a pandemic H1N1 vaccine , but were of too low magnitude to induce robust heterosubtypic protection [64] .', 'Until neutralizing antibodies can be generated against an antigen conserved between many different influenza subtypes , humans will remain vulnerable to the threat of a pandemic from a novel influenza strain such as H7N7 , H9N2 , etc .', '[65] .', 'Another promising potential universal influenza vaccine targets the ectodomain of matrix protein 2 ( M2e ) [66] .', 'The M2e sequence is conserved across influenza virus subtypes , and humoral anti-M2e immunity has been shown to protect against influenza virus challenge in mice [67] , [68] .', 'However , M2e-based protection does not prevent or resolve infection and is of a lower potency that HA-specific antibodies , making an M2e-dependent therapy more likely to act as a safety net in the case of the emergence of pandemic influenza strains rather than a replacement for current vaccines [69] .', 'One concern associated with both broadly neutralizing antibodies and M2e based vaccines is that widespread use of these vaccines will introduce immune pressure promoting the evolution of antigenic escape viruses [66] .', 'There have already been reports of escape viruses being generated in response to M2e antibodies , with one study finding that virus mutants with antigenic changes in M2e emerged in 65% of virus-infected mice treated

have implicated NP-specific IgG in heterosubtypic immunity to influenza virus [28] , [29] .', 'This previous work found that NP protein was detectable in the BAL and nasal washes of influenza virus-infected mice , thereby allowing the NP antigen to interact with NP-specific antibodies and form complexes to stimulate antiviral immune responses .', 'These studies also demonstrated that 5 daily antibody injections starting 3 days prior to infection were required to reduce viral load in naïve mice , using a 0 . 25 lethal dose 50% ( LD50 ) influenza rechallenge .', 'Our findings extend this work in determining that cooperativity between influenza virus-specific CD8+ T cells and antibodies is important for heterosubtypic protection in immune competent mice .', 'NP-specific antibodies are likely to be a primary component of the X31-GP33 serum used in our work .', 'The cooperativity we demonstrated may mean that excessively high amounts of non-neutralizing antibodies might not be required if virus-specific CD8+ T cells are also present .', 'Since previous influenza virus infections or vaccinations have likely induced anti-NP antibodies and influenza virus-specific memory CD8+ T cells in most adults , it is interesting that more heterologous protection does not seem to exist in humans .', 'One reason may be that sufficiently high titers of anti-NP antibodies are not present in adults to mediate cooperative protection .', 'Indeed one report indicates that trivalent inactivated influenza virus vaccine ( TIV ) only rarely and modestly boosted existing levels of anti-NP IgG [32] .', 'Alternatively , perhaps such cooperative immunity is , in fact , one reason for the relatively low mortality in healthy adults for most strains of influenza virus .', 'Our results suggest that it will be interesting to test whether this cooperative immunity might wane with increasing age , a theory supported by several reports [26]–[29] .', 'It is possible that the lack of CD8 T cell boosting by the yearly vaccine allows CD8 T cell memory to decline over time even in healthy young adults .', 'Future studies will be necessary to test some of these ideas in humans .', 'The mechanism by which non-neutralizing antibodies operate in the setting of heterosubtypic immunity remains poorly understood .', 'Unlike neutralizing antibodies , non-neutralizing antibodies do not prevent viral entry into host cells and must therefore employ a different means of action to reduce viral load .', 'FcRs have been reported to be important mediators of this process , but the specific cell types directly involved in reducing influenza viral load and pathology by this mechanism are unclear .', 'Alveolar macrophages have been shown to play a critical role in influenza virus protection , likely through ADCC or phagocytosis [71] , [72] .', 'Some reports have also suggested that NK-cells may be involved in influenza virus protection through ADCC [59] , although several recent studies have found this to be unlikely [73] , [74] .', 'The complement pathway could also have an important role due to the ability of complement to bind and lyse infected cells or enveloped virus in the presence of antibodies .', 'Complement has been demonstrated to be able to neutralize the influenza virus in the presence of natural antibodies [75] , and complement component C3 may be important in T cell priming and migration to the lungs [76] .', 'Indeed , C3 deficiency in humans correlates with recurrent infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract [77] .', 'In the current studies we found

macrophages while leaving the interstitial macrophage population as well as other cell types in the lungs intact [71] , [78]–[80] .', 'However , the possibility of off target effects of the clodronate liposome approach cannot be fully excluded .', 'The unimpaired CD8+ T cell response found in clodronate-treated mice ( Fig . S3A ) however , suggested that depletion of dendritic cells was unlikely to be responsible for the lack of protection in this setting .', 'Thus , alveolar macrophages are likely a major cell type impacted by this treatment and are expected to act to help reduce viral load through recognition of the Fc region of non-neutralizing antibodies .', 'This recognition can lead to ADCC and/or antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis directed against infected cells bound by non-neutralizing antibodies .', 'The reduced effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines and greater infection-related morbidity and mortality in the elderly is thought to be due to alterations in both the innate and adaptive immune response that occur with age [3] , [81]–[84] .', 'Among the alterations reported in the elderly that could influence immunity to infection are changes in macrophages , NK cells , neutrophils , pathogen recognition via Toll-like receptors , innate cell cytokine production [85] , [86] , as well as decreased numbers , proliferation and signaling of B and T cells [87]–[91] .', 'Interestingly , there have also been reports of changes in FcRs that occur with age , which could lead to defects in FcR-dependent effector functions [92] .', 'While it has been shown that CD8+ T cell and neutralizing antibody-based protection obtained at a young age is still protective many years later [93]–[95] , less is known about non-neutralizing antibody-dependent protection .', 'Since this type of protection relies on FcR-dependent effector mechanisms to clear infected cells it will be important to determine if the heterosubtypic protection observed in young mice is also seen in aged groups of animals .', 'A major goal of “universal” influenza vaccines is to elicit cross-subtype influenza virus protection in both young and aged populations .', 'Hence , age-related defects in the immune system are a critical issue that must be addressed in future studies to determine if cooperative protection is an effective strategy in eliciting heterosubtypic influenza protection .', 'Collectively , we have shown that influenza virus-specific CD8+ T cells in cooperation with non-neutralizing antibodies are able to provide optimal protection against a lethal influenza virus rechallenge .', 'This protection is only exhibited when both influenza virus-specific CD8+ T cells and non-neutralizing antibodies are present .', 'Furthermore , non-neutralizing antibodies likely contribute to influenza virus clearance , possibly through a mechanism involving alveolar macrophages .', 'It should be pointed out that while we have focused largely on CD8+ T cells , it is possible that cooperative protection will occur for CD4+ T cells and non-neutralizing antibodies .', 'Indeed , there is good evidence that CD4+ T cells can contribute to protective immunity to influenza virus [35] , [96] , [97] and cooperate with naïve B and CD8+ T cells [36] .', 'It will be important to address this issue in the future .', 'This work provides novel insights into cross-subtype influenza virus protection and could have implications for the development of a universal influenza vaccine .'], ['This study was carried out in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health .', 'Protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use ( IACUC ) committees of the Wistar Institute , ( animal welfare assurance number A3432-01 ) or University of Pennsylvania ( animal welfare assurance number A3079-01 ) .', 'The Wistar and University of Pennsylvania Animal Care and Use Programs are fully accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International ( AAALAC ) .', 'C57BL/6 and Ly5 . 1+ mice were purchased from the National Cancer Institute ( Frederick , MD ) or Jackson Laboratories ( Bar Harbor , ME ) .', 'Age- and sex matched IL-15-/- mice were obtained from Taconic ( Germantown , NY ) , FcRγ knockout mice ( FcRγ KO; strain name B6 . 129P2-Fcer1gtm1RavN12 ) were purchased from Taconic Farms , Inc .

the severity of the disease is a function of both parasite replication and the immune response .', 'These obligate intracellular parasites infect phagocytes , such as macrophages , and are controlled when macrophages become activated by IFN-γ .', 'Thus , a Th1 response is a required component in controlling the disease .', 'However , the immune response itself can contribute to the pathology associated with this infection .', 'The most extreme example of this is in mucosal or mucocutaneous leishmaniasis , although it is important to point out that even in localized cutaneous leishmaniasis the immune response is largely responsible for the lesions that develop [1]–[6] .', 'Thus , it is the inflammatory response , rather than uncontrolled parasite growth , that often perpetuates the disease .', 'For this reason , regulatory mechanisms that dampen the immune response are critical for controlling the disease .', 'Indeed , cells from patients with mucosal leishmaniasis produce less IL-10 than those with localized cutaneous disease , and cells within the mucosal lesions exhibit a reduced expression of the IL-10 receptor ( IL-10R ) [2] , [7]–[9] .', 'These observations suggest that the lack of IL-10 or responsiveness to IL-10 may be an important contributing factor in the immunopathology observed in this disease .', 'A better understanding of the pathogenesis of mucosal disease is important , since drug therapy is often not successful in these patients [10]–[13] .', 'It is believed that high levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α contribute to the disease , which might provide targets for immunotherapy [14] , [15] .', 'More recently , increased levels of IL-17 have been identified in patients with cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis , suggesting that IL-17 may also play a pro-inflammatory role in this disease and could be a target for immunotherapy [16] , [17] .', 'Moreover , BALB/c mice lacking IL-17 develop significantly smaller lesions than control mice [18] .', 'On the other hand , IL-17 has been associated with protection against human visceral leishmaniasis and was required in a vaccine model [19] , [20] .', 'Thus , the role of IL-17 in leishmaniasis remains poorly understood , and further studies are required to determine if blocking IL-17 will be therapeutic in severe cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis .', 'C57BL/6 mice infected with L . major develop lesions similar to those seen in patients with localized cutaneous leishmaniasis , and after 10 to 12 weeks the lesions resolve .', 'Healing is associated with the development of a Th1 response , leading to increased levels of IFN-γ , activation of macrophages , and subsequent killing of the parasites by nitric oxide .', 'These protective responses are held in check by the production of IL-10 , since C57BL/6 mice lacking IL-10 produce higher levels of IFN-γ and are better able to control the parasites [21] , [22] .', 'IL-10 also regulates Th2 responses in leishmaniasis .', 'Thus , BALB/c mice develop an uncontrolled disease that occurs concomitantly with a dominant Th2 response , while BALB/c Il10−/− mice resolve their infections [23] .', 'L . major infected Il27r−/− mice develop more severe pathology than wild-type mice , and also exhibit decreased IL-10 levels concomitant with a Th2 response that may also contribute to the disease [24] , [25] .', 'Thus , IL-10 has previously been shown to be important in regulating the immune response to leishmaniasis , but a murine model that mimics the severe pathology seen when an exaggerated Th1 type immune response develops in leishmaniasis remains unexplored .', 'To develop a model to study Th1 associated pathology in leishmaniasis , we infected C57BL/6 mice in the ear with L . major , while simultaneously inhibiting IL-10 effects with anti-IL-10 receptor mAb .', 'This treatment created mice that were IL-10 signaling deficient ( IL10SD ) .', 'IL10SD mice , as well as L . major infected Il10−/− mice , developed significantly larger lesions than the controls , but had fewer parasites within the lesions .', 'We found that IL-10 was primarily produced by CD4+Foxp3+ and CD4+Foxp3− cells .', 'As expected , there was a significant increase in the production of IFN-γ in IL10SD mice early after infection , which mediated both increased recruitment of monocytes as well as iNOS production .', 'We also found a significant increase in IL-17 production and neutrophil accumulation in the lesions of IL10SD mice .', 'Therefore , we next addressed the question of whether IFN-γ or IL-17 ( or both ) was required for the development of immunopathology in the absence of IL-10 signaling .', 'Instead of decreasing pathology , IFN-γ neutralization in IL10SD mice resulted in increased pathology as assessed by lesion size , with a substantial increase in IL-17 production and neutrophil infiltration .', 'In contrast , IL-17 neutralization in IL10SD mice abrogated the increased pathology seen in IL10SD mice

for IL-17 production in many systems [26]–[29] , we assessed the course of infection in Il1r1−/− mice that were treated with anti-IL-10R mAb .', 'We found that Il1r1−/− mice failed to develop severe pathology when treated with anti-IL10R mAb , and correspondingly showed reduced IL-17 levels and the lack of neutrophil recruitment .', 'Taken together , these results indicate that IL-17 can mediate extensive pathology in leishmaniasis if not regulated by IL-10 , and that in the absence of IL-10 , IFN-γ plays a critical role in regulating IL-17 production .'], ['Since the lack of IL-10 or IL-10 receptor expression has been linked with the increased pathology seen in mucosal patients , we investigated whether neutralization of IL-10 responses would lead to a more severe disease .', 'C57BL/6

obtained in Il10−/− mice ( Figure 1C , D ) .', 'The lesions in IL10SD mice were not only larger in size , but also substantially more ulcerated ( Figure 1E ) .', 'In fact , as the lesions increased in size some of the IL10SD mice lost substantial ear tissue after 4 weeks of infection , which impacted measuring lesions , such that there was an apparent decrease in lesion size of IL10SD mice .', 'Of note , severe pathology continued to be apparent weeks after anti-IL-10R administration was discontinued , suggesting that IL-10 produced early after infection is critical in the subsequent lesion development .', 'Histologically , the lesions were associated with a leukocytic infiltration in the dermal layer with a predominance of mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells .', 'In particular , the lesions in IL-10SD mice exhibited microabscesses in the dermis and marked epidermal thickening compromising the stratum corneum , spinous and basal layers ( Figure 1F ) .', 'Several cell types can produce IL-10 following infection with L . major [23] , [30] , [31] .', 'We reasoned that the critical IL-10 associated with the induction of increased pathology was produced relatively early after infection .', 'Therefore , we utilized IL-10 transcriptional reporter mice to define the cells within the lesions that were making IL-10 at one week of infection .', 'We observed a substantial increase in IL-10 expression by CD4+ T cells following infection .', 'In addition , CD8 T cells infiltrating the lesions produced IL-10 , and there was a slight increase in IL-10 production by CD11b+

to determine if blocking IL-10R signaling altered the ability of these cells to make IL-10 , we compared IL-10 production by CD4+ T cells ( both Foxp3+ and Foxp3− ) in IL-10SD and control mice .', 'The absolute number of IL-10 producing of CD4+Foxp3− and CD4+ Foxp3+ T cells did not differ between controls and IL10SD mice .', 'However , we found a modest , although significant , decrease in the percentage of IL-10 producing regulatory T cells ( Tregs ) when IL-10R was blocked .', 'A more dramatic effect was observed in CD4+Foxp3− T cells , where the treatment reduced the frequency of IL-10 producing Foxp3− cells to that observed in naïve mice ( Figure 2D ) .', 'These results indicate that the ability of Th1 cells to make IL-10 is partially dependent upon IL-10 itself .', 'Whether the IL-10 initiating IL-10 production by CD4+ T cells is produced in an autocrine manner , or from other cells , such as macrophages that are known to produce IL-10 following interactions with Leishmania parasites [23] , is unknown .', 'IL-10 suppresses immune responses , and thus not surprisingly we found increased T cell responses in IL10SD mice .', 'We harvested the draining lymph nodes from control and treated mice , and stimulated these cells with leishmanial antigen to assess what differences we might observe in cytokine production .', 'There was a significant increase of IFN-γ production in response to leishmanial antigen stimulation in cells from treated mice ( Figure 3A ) .', 'In contrast , there was a decrease in IL-4 production , which most likely is due to an increase in IFN-γ ( and IL-12 ) in IL10SD mice .', 'In addition to the development of a stronger Th1 response , we also found that T cells from treated mice produced more IL-17 ( Figure 3A ) .', 'Little to no IL-17 was produced by cells from L . major infected ( isotype ) controls , suggesting that not only did IL-10 neutralization increase cytokine responses that were already present ( e . g . IFN-γ ) , but also uncovered responses that were low or non-existent .', 'We next examined the production of IFN-γ and IL-17 within the lesions at 1 and 5 weeks after infection .', 'As early as 1 week after infection , there was a significant increase in the percentage and number of Th1 cells present within the lesions compared with naïve or control ( isotype treated and infected ) mice ( Figure 3B ) .', 'Nevertheless , by 5 weeks , IFN-γ responses were similar in treated and untreated mice .', 'There is a high frequency of IL-17 producing cells in naïve mice that is probably dependent upon the skin commensal microbiota [32] .', 'Interestingly , the frequency of IL-17 producing CD4 T cells within the ear decreased in infected mice at 1 week , which is presumably due to the recruitment of CD4 T cells that did not make IL-17 .', 'However , the number and frequency of IL-17 producing cells in IL10SD mice was increased compared with the infected controls .', 'In addition , there was an increase in the mean fluorescence intensity in the Th17 cells ( Figure 3C ) .', 'The CD4+ Th17 cells that developed in IL10SD mice failed to co-produce either IFN-γ or IL-10 ( Figure 3D , E ) as reported in other systems [33] , [34]_ENREF_11 .', 'There was also a slight increase in IL-17 production by CD8 and γδ T cells in IL10SD mice compared with controls ( data not shown ) .', 'Thus , in IL10SD mice there is an increase in both Th1 and Th17 cells compared with infected controls .', 'In order to better understand the development of disease in the anti-IL-10R mAb treated mice , we characterized the early cellular infiltrate within the lesions .', 'Myeloid populations were identified as CD11b+ cells , and further classified based on their expression of additional markers ( Ly6C , Ly6G , CD11b and MHCII ) .', 'We found a significant increase in the frequency and absolute number of CD11b+ cells by 1 week of infection ( Figure 4A ) .', 'Monocytes ( Ly6C+ ) and neutrophils ( Ly6G+ ) were recruited to leishmanial lesions soon after infection , and at 1 week we saw an increase in both of these cell populations in the infected control mice .', 'However , in IL-10SD mice we found significantly larger numbers of both monocytes and neutrophils .', 'Thus , while approximately 40% of the CD11b+Ly6G− cells were monocytes in infected control mice , this increased to more than 70% of the CD11b+ Ly6G− cells in IL-10SD mice ( Figure 4A ) .', 'Similarly , an increased frequency of neutrophils contributed to the early increase of CD11b+ cells within the lesions of treated mice ( Figure 4A ) .', 'By 5 weeks neutrophils dominated the lesions in IL10SD mice ( Figure S1 ) .', 'Administration of anti-IL-10R mAb also promoted the activation status of CD11b+ cells .', 'Thus , a large percentage of the CD11b+ cells recovered from the site during the first week of infection of IL10SD mice were significantly more activated than infected control mice , as measured by iNOS and MHC class II expression on CD11b+Ly6C+ cells ( Figure 4B ) .', 'This increase in recruitment and activation of monocytes was completely T cell dependent , since it failed to occur in anti-IL-10R mAb treated Rag−/− mice ( Figure S2 ) .', 'To determine if IFN-γ controlled this early monocyte response , we treated mice with anti- IFN-γ during the first week of infection , and assessed monocyte recruitment and activation .', 'We found a significant decrease in the recruitment of monocytes to the site of infection ( Figure 5A ) .', 'Additionally , MHC class II and iNOS expression was reduced in both infected C57BL/6 and IL10SD ( Figure 5A ) .', 'Strikingly , we found that neutralization of IFN-γ led to a significant increase in the lesion size by 1 week of infection .', 'This was not due to a change in the parasite burden at this early time point ( Figure 5B ) , but rather was associated with a substantial increase in the recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection , such that in IFN-γ neutralized IL10SD mice 75% of the CD11b+ cells in lesions were neutrophils ( Figure 5C ) .', 'This increase in neutrophils corresponded with an increase in IL-17 production ( Figure 5D ) .', 'These results are consistent with previous observations that IFN-γ regulates IL-17 responses [35]–[37] .', 'More importantly , this result suggests that instead of IFN-γ promoting increased pathology , IFN-γ may be critical for downregulating IL-17 responses .', 'Thus , in the absence of IFN-γ an uncontrolled IL-17 response leads to a dramatic increase in neutrophils and subsequent pathology .', 'To determine if IL-10-mediated regulation of IL-17 , as describe by others [38]–[40] , could also be observed in patients with leishmaniasis .', 'We first asked whether IL-10 was able to inhibit IL-17 production .', 'Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with soluble leishmanial antigen ( SLA ) in the presence or absence of IL-10 .', 'After 4 days we harvested the supernatants

cells from leishmaniasis patients with SLA in the presence or absence of anti-IFN-γ monoclonal antibody .', 'In these experiments 8 out of 9 patients produced more IL-17 when anti-IFN-γ was included in the cultures ( Figure 5F ) .', 'Thus , taken together , our studies with cells from leishmaniasis patients indicate that similar to the murine model , both IL-10 and IFN-γ inhibit IL-17 production

IL10SD mice .', 'Mice were treated with anti-IL-10R mAb , anti-IL-17 mAb or both simultaneously , and lesion development was monitored .', 'While IL-10SD mice exhibited larger lesions , there was a significant reduction in lesion size when IL10SD mice were treated with anti-IL-17 mAb ( Figure 6A ) .', 'Of note , neutralization of IL-17 had no effect on parasite numbers ( Figure 6B ) .', 'We observed that the number of neutrophils decreased in anti-IL-17 mAb treated IL-10SD mice in comparison to IL-10SD mice ( Figure 6C ) .', 'The antigen-specific IL-17 production by draining lymph node

determine what cytokines might be promoting the increased IL-17 responses in IL10SD mice , we looked at gene expression of IL-6 , IL-23 , TGFβ1 and IL-1β 1 week after infection of control and IL10SD

high IFN-γ and TNF-α production , but very few parasites present within the lesions [2]–[4] .', 'Importantly , cells from these patients appear to produce less IL-10 when stimulated with leishmanial antigens than cells from self-healing patients , and within the lesions there is low expression of the IL-10 receptor [2] , [7]–[9] .', 'Thus , it is presumed that a lack of regulatory mechanisms in

distance between these copies is 0 . 47 , which suggests they were active around the time when the neo-sex chromosomes of D . robusta were formed ( mean dS: 0 . 39 ) .', 'Thus , enrichment of this TE on the neo-X of D . robusta , its occurrence within CESs and the presence of a binding motif for the MSL complex , and its inferred time of mobilization around the formation of neo-sex chromosomes

highly opportunistic but contingent on genomic background .', 'In particular , we find that each independently evolved neo-X chromosome uses a diverse set of mutational pathways to acquire MSL-binding sites on a new neo-X chromosome , ranging from microsatellite expansions to the utilization of presites to TE insertions .', 'However , different lineages differ with regards to the frequency of which

mutation ) and transpose until they are silenced by the host genome [56] .', 'Once a TE is robustly repressed , it no longer can serve as a vehicle to disperse regulatory elements , so the time window when a particular TE family can be domesticated is probably short and needs to coincide with a necessity to disperse regulatory motifs .', 'A high TE burden does increase that chance , but at a cost:

cells overexpressing Pin3 or Cyc8C .', 'Like Pin4C , overexpressed Pin3 caused Hsp104-GFP to coalesce into large aggregates and reduced the level of diffuse cytoplasmic Hsp104-GFP fluorescence relative to empty vector controls .', 'However , overexpressed Pin3 also caused a slight increase in the cellular levels of Hsp104 , Sse1 , Ydj1 and Sis1 ( Figure S6A ) .', 'The combined result of these two effects was that the Hsp104 cytoplasmic level was about 74% of that seen in cells without Pin4C overexpression ( Figure 7C ) .', 'Likewise , although overexpressed Pin3 caused Sis1-GFP to coalesce ( Figure 8A ) , the levels of Sis1 that remained in the cytoplasm were similar to controls ( Figure 8B ) .', 'In contrast to overexpressed Pin4C or Pin3 , overexpressed Cyc8C caused an 8-fold increase in the Hsp104 level ( Figure S6B ) , and did not sequester Hsp104 ( Figure 7B ) .', 'Overexpressed Cyc8C also caused a slight increase in the Sis1 level ( Figure S6B ) .', 'We next investigate if non-Q/N-rich aggregates that cure [PSI+] also sequester chaperones .', 'Gpg1 is a mimic of a G protein γ subunit .', 'Like overexpressed Pin4C , overexpressed Gpg1 formed aggregates , had reduced curing efficiency when Hsp104 was overexpressed , but did not affect the cellular levels of Hsp104 [79] .', 'Previous work visualizing Gpg1 curing of [PSI+] aggregates was complicated by the use of overexpressed Sup35NM-GFP [79] .', 'When we examined the effect of excess Gpg1 on fluorescent aggregates in [PSI+] cells with endogenous Sup35 tagged with GFP , we found that the fluorescent dots got larger and fewer in number ( Figure 10A ) , just as seen when Pin4C was overexpressed .', 'Furthermore , like excess Pin4C , excess Gpg1 caused endogenous Hsp104 tagged with GFP to aggregate into foci .', 'However , despite this aggregation we did not detect any reduction in the intensity of cytoplasmic Hsp104-GFP compared to the vector control ( Figure 10B ) .'], ['Surprisingly , several factors that enhance prion induction also cause prion destabilization: [PIN+] both facilitates [PSI+] appearance and destabilizes [PSI+] [51] , [59]; overexpression of the Ure2 prion domain both induces de novo [URE3] appearance and cures [URE3] [60]; overexpression of the same chaperones both enhance de novo [URE3] generation and destabilize existing [URE3] [80] .', 'We now report that overexpression of many of the 11 Q/N-rich proteins , which in high copy substitute for the [PIN+] requirement for [PSI+] induction , also destabilize pre-existing [PSI+] or [URE3] ( Figure 1 ) , indicating that Q/N-rich proteins can also both enhance prion appearance and impair propagation of existing prions .', 'Our finding that the high copy plasmids encoding 11 Q/N-rich domains can promote the de novo induction of [PSI+] in an rnq1Δ strain , establishes that the induction of [PSI+] does not first require the appearance of [PIN+] .', 'Rather , this suggests a direct interaction between heterologous Q/N-rich proteins and Sup35 , and , as originally hypothesized [3] , and as indicated by earlier in vitro studies [54] , [58] , that the Q/N-rich proteins themselves are likely substituting for [PIN+] as the cross-seeds .', 'Since certain [PIN+] variants ( e . g . low [PIN+] , medium [PIN+] and very high [PIN+] but not high [PIN+] ) destabilize [PSI+] , curing of [PSI+] by Q/N-rich proteins could result from changing the [PSI+]-inducing high [PIN+] into a destabilizing [PIN+] .', 'However , this seems unlikely because the effects of the destabilizing [PIN+]s are limited to weak but not strong [PSI+] [59] , while overexpressed Pin4C also cures strong [PSI+] .', 'Furthermore , overexpressed Q/N-rich proteins caused loss of weak [PSI+] even without [PIN+] ( data not shown ) .', 'Other previously hypothesized mechanisms of prion curing by Q/N-rich proteins are that the overexpressed Q/N-rich domain of Ure2 inhibits prion fiber growth leading to curing of [URE3] , either by incorporating into the growing tip of the [URE3] seed thereby blocking or “capping” its growth [60] , [81] , [82] , or by sequestering Ure2 preventing it from joining prion fibers [81] , [82] .', 'However , this mechanism implies a very efficient interaction between the curing protein and the prion-forming protein , which is likely only in the case of very high homology .', 'Our studies indicate that overexpression of Pin4C allows [PSI+] aggregates to continuously incorporate soluble Sup35 , but prevents proper fragmentation ( Figure 2 , Figure 3 , Figure 4 , Figure 5 ) .', 'Thus , overproduced Pin4C causes [PSI+] loss via a defect in breakage of growing [PSI+] fibers and transmission of prion seeds .', 'This is quite different from either the capping or sequestration of its own protein models .', 'Since prion fragmentation is crucially dependent on chaperones , particularly on Hsp104 , overexpressed Pin4C could affect the function of Hsp104 on [PSI+] .', 'One possibility is that Pin4C coats [PSI+] aggregates through the interaction of their Q/N-rich domains and thus shields Sup35 polymers from the shearing activity of chaperones .', 'However , we did not detect co-localization of Sup35-GFP and Pin4C-DsRed foci ( Figure 2B ) .', 'Although there is no significant alteration in total levels of chaperones ( Figure S4 ) , excess Pin4C sequesters Hsp104 and Sis1 ( Figure 6 , Figure 7 , Figure 8 ) , reducing their availability to shear [PSI+] aggregates .', 'Although depletion of Sis1 only causes delayed and gradual loss of [PSI+] [35] , the reduced availability of Sis1 may enhance the effect of Hsp104 sequestration .', 'Furthermore , although excess Sis1 prevented curing of [PSI+] by Pin4C overexpression , excess Sis1 also decreases Pin4C aggregation ( Figure 9 ) .', 'We also observed that different Q/N-rich proteins had distinct effects toward the yeast Q/N-rich prions , [PSI+] and [URE3] ( Figure 1 ) .', 'For example , our data is consistent with the recent study showing that overproduction of New1 does not cure [PSI+] [83] , but we further uncover that overexpressed New1 does cause efficient curing of [URE3] .', 'Likewise , Pin3 cures [URE3] but not [PSI+] .', 'One explanation could be that these proteins sequester Hsp104 less efficiently than the proteins that cure both prions such as Pin4C .', 'Indeed , we found that overexpressed Pin3 reduced the cytoplasmic level of Hsp104 less effectively than Pin4C ( Figure 7 and Figure S6A ) .', 'Since more than 50% of the cellular Hsp104 remained diffuse when Pin3 was overexpressed , curing of [PSI+] would not be expected [76] .', 'However , since there are fewer prion seeds in [URE3] than weak [PSI+] cells [35] , this slight reduction in soluble Hsp104 might be sufficient to cure [URE3] .', 'Indeed , previous studies showed that different prions and different prion variants have different susceptibilities towards chaperone activities [37] , [69] , [84] .', 'Although overexpressed Pin3 sequestered Sis1 ( Figure 8A ) , there was no significant difference in the fluorescence intensity of diffuse Sis1-GFP in the cytoplasm with Pin3 overexpression compared to the control without Pin3 overexpression ( Figure 8B ) , suggesting that sequestration of Sis1 by excess Pin3 does not significantly contribute to curing of [URE3] .', 'There was also a slight increase in the total cellular levels of Sse1 and Ydj1 , which could contribute to the Pin3 curing .', 'Surprisingly , overexpression of Cyc8C cures [PSI+] but not [URE3] ( Figure 1 ) .', 'This cannot be explained by sequestration of Hsp104 .', 'Indeed , overexpression of Cyc8C did not cause aggregation of Hsp104 ( Figure 7B ) , but rather increased the Hsp104 level 8-fold while having no effect on Ssa1 ( Figure S6B ) .', 'Since overexpression of Hsp104 cures [PSI+] but not [URE3] [16] , [42] , this provides a plausible mechanism .', 'We also observed a slight increase in the Sis1 level by overexpressed Cyc8C ( Figure S6B ) .', 'It was previously shown that overproduced Sis1 enhances curing of [PSI+] by overexpressed Hsp104 [80] , therefore overexpressed Cyc8C may cure [PSI+] through additive effects of the increased level of Hsp104 and Sis1 .', 'Our findings may provide an explanation for previous observations that overexpressed proteins lead to curing of prions .', 'Overexpression of the Rnq1Δ100 protein ( the Q/N-rich C-terminal domain ) eliminates [PSI+] and [URE3] in the presence of [PIN+] [61] .', 'Also mutations in the non-Q/N-rich domains of RNQ1 cause an increase in the size of Sup35 aggregates leading to curing [62] .', 'Both of these phenomena could be because the Rnq1 fragment or mutants form [PIN+]-dependent aggregates that sequester Hsp104 and/or other chaperones and reduce their availability to aid [PSI+] propagation .', 'The chaperone titration curing mechanism may also be applicable to non-Q/N-rich aggregates .', 'Indeed , a similar mechanism could explain prion curing caused by overexpression of the non-Q/N-rich protein Gpg1 ( Figure 10 ) .', 'Although Gpg1 sequestered Hsp104 , we could not detect a reduction in cytoplasmic Hsp104 .', 'Nonetheless , other chaperones might also be sequestered by Gpg1 aggregates leading to reduced prion shearing and prion loss .', 'A recent study also indicates that the cellular localization of chaperones can have a direct impact prion propagation .', 'Indeed , this appears to explain the long-standing mystery of why overexpression of Hsp104 cures cells of [PSI+] but not of other prions [16] , [36] , [42] , [51] .', 'Hsp104 overexpression was shown to inhibit shearing of [PSI+] aggregates because the excess of Hsp104 displaced the Hsp70 chaperone Ssa1 from the [PSI+] aggregate .', 'Hsp104 does not bind to other prions in the absence of Ssa1 , consistent with the absence of curing [29] .', 'Other studies also indicate that titration of cellular proteins by amyloid aggregates can have a profound effect on the cell .', 'Indeed , sequestration of essential proteins by amyloid aggregates was previously shown to cause prion toxicity .', 'The large Sup35 aggregate that forms when Sup35 is overexpressed in [PSI+] cells sequesters the essential Sup35 binding partner Sup45 , resulting in death [68] .', 'Likewise , the large Rnq1 aggregates that form when Rnq1 is overexpressed in [PIN+] cells sequester the core spindle pole body component Spc42 causing toxicity [85] .', 'Also , polyglutamine ( polyQ ) aggregates sequester essential endocytic components such as Sla2 [86] and endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation proteins in [PIN+] dependent toxicity [87] , and sequester Sup35 in [PSI+]-dependent polyQ toxicity [88] .', 'Our results establish sequestration of specific chaperones by overexpressed proteins as a general mechanism to alter the cellular localization of chaperones and therefore inhibit prion propagation .', 'Similar mechanisms could influence phenotypic variation by regulating the balance of chaperones needed for prion propagation , in response to environmental stimuli .', 'Since biochemical pathways controlling prion formation and/or maintenance appear to be conserved from yeast to mammals , titration of chaperones via heterologous Q/N-rich aggregates might provide a new approach to prion and amyloid disease
