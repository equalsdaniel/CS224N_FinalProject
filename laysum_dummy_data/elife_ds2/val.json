differences in the numbers of neutrophils ( CD11b+ Ly6Ghi ) because neutrophils were detected at comparable levels in WT and Skap2-/-\u00a0lungs , bone marrow as well as bronchoalveolar lavage of infected mice ( Figure 1C; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A\u2013D ) .", "In addition , there was no difference in alveolar macrophages ( CD11bint CD11chi ) , resident monocytes ( CD11b+ Gr1lo ) ,

required for K . pneumoniae-stimulated ROS production , and that the loss of SKAP2 prevents full phosphorylation of SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 after K . pneumoniae stimulation such that neutrophils are unable to generate ROS production ."], ["Our experiments reveal that SKAP2 plays a key role in host defense in the hematopoietic compartment against K . pneumoniae 43816 in pulmonary infections in a

burden in the Skap2-/-\u00a0mice is affected by the loss of ROS .", "Sensitivity of K . pneumoniae to ROS is strongly supported by the increased bacterial burden in Cybb-/- mice during lung infection , and observations in CGD patients ( Wolach et al . , 2017; Paczosa et al . , 2020 ) .", "In murine neutrophils , SKAP2 was required for full phosphorylation of SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 , demonstrating a critical role in K . pneumoniae-induced signaling pathways that are required for ROS production .", "Consistent with previous findings ( Regueiro et al . , 2006; March et al . , 2013 ) , K .

one using K . pneumoniae 43816 , have shown that degranulation of myeloperoxidase , ELA2 , and cathepsin G are important for reducing bacterial burden of K . pneumoniae in mice ( Hirche et al . , 2005; Zhao et al . , 2015 ) .", "However , we found that despite equivalent levels of ELA2 , degranulation in Skap2-/-\u00a0mice was not sufficient to control K . pneumoniae burden in the absence of ROS , indicating that neutrophil ROS and degranulation may cooperate in containing K . pneumoniae infection .", "Since degranulation occurred normally in Skap2-/-\u00a0lungs , the pathways of ROS production are distinct from signaling pathways regulating degranulation in murine neutrophils after K . pneumoniae infection .", "Neutrophils and ROS contribute to the defense against other pathogens

findings and work of others ( Figure 6; Alenghat et al . , 2012; Swanson et al . , 2008; Togni et al . , 2005; Timms et al . , 1999 ) .", "Following K . pneumoniae infection , activation of receptors , like GPCRs recognizing N-formylated bacterial proteins or mincle recognizing bacterial lectins , leads to the activation of phosphoinositide 3 kinase ( PI3K ) and the generation of phosphatidylinositol [3 , 4 , 5]-triphosphate ( PIP3 ) , resulting in PIP3-mediated SKAP2 activation and membrane localization ( Figure 6A\u2013B; Futosi et al . , 2013; Swanson et al . , 2008; Sharma et al . , 2014; Alenghat et al . , 2012 ) .", "The activated ( open ) phosphorylated SKAP2 complex can then bind to and enhance phosphorylation of SFKs shifting their active/inactive equilibrium to more active forms and leading to Syk activation ( Figure 6B; Marie-Cardine et al . , 1998; Bureau et al . , 2018; Kouroku et al . , 1998; Lowell , 2011 ) .", "This is supported by previous biochemical and pull-down studies showing that SKAP2 can directly interact with SFKs ( Bureau et al . , 2018; Liu et al . , 1998; Wang and Rudd , 2008 ) .", "SFKs and Syk may directly associate with and activate Pyk2 , as observed in response to GPCRs , integrin , TNF\u03b1 , and/or Salmonella stimulation ( Dikic et al . , 1996; Evangelista et al . , 2007; Han et al . , 2003; M\u00f3csai et al . , 2002 ) .",

mechanisms would promote stabilization and propagation of SFKs/Syk/Pyk2 phosphorylation in activated murine neutrophil leading to ROS .", "While SFKs , Syk , and Pyk2 have been shown to be important for degranulation in murine and human neutrophils ( Van Ziffle and Lowell , 2009; Kamen et al . , 2011; M\u00f3csai et al . , 1999; Han et al . , 2003 ) , we observed degranulation in murine lungs and low levels of phosphorylation after K . pneumoniae infection in murine neutrophils in vitro .", "These low levels may be sufficient to induced degranulation through a SKAP2-independent signaling pathway .", "Alternatively , specific phosphorylation sites of SFKs or Syk not tested here may still occurred in the absence of SKAP2 and be sufficient to induce degranulation ( Carsetti et al . , 2009; Tsang et al . , 2008; Moroco et al . , 2014; M\u00f3csai et al . , 2010 ) .", "In addition , different domains of Pyk2 regulate ROS and degranulation ( Han et al . , 2003 ) .", "Specifically , the inhibition of the carboxy-terminus of Pyk2 in human neutrophils leads to a reduction in ROS production in response to TNF , Salmonella , and Listeria , but did not impair neutrophil degranulation and bacterial killing ( Han et al . , 2003 ) .", "SKAP2 may impact the carboxy-terminus of Pyk2 in murine neutrophils , but not activation of other domains .", "Skap2-/- mice have normal levels of circulating neutrophils and Skap2-/-\u00a0neutrophils were present in K . pneumoniae-infected lungs at a similar , and sometimes higher , levels as WT neutrophils ( Figure 1C\u2013D; Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1A ) and ( Togni et al . , 2005 ) .", "However , prior studies revealed that Skap2-/-\u00a0myeloid cells , including\u00a0neutrophils , have impaired recruitment and migration into\u00a0tissues\u00a0during sterile inflammation ( Tanaka et al . , 2016; Boras et al . , 2017 ) .", "This suggests that migration to sterile , but not infectious sites , may require SKAP2 , which is consistent with findings with Syk .", "Syk is required for neutrophil migration in an inflammatory model but not during bacterial infection ( Zarbock et al . , 2007; Frommhold et al . , 2007; Van Ziffle and Lowell , 2009; Schymeinsky et al . , 2006 ) .", "Alternatively , it is possible that Skap2-/-\u00a0neutrophils may have a reduced migration level in K . pneumoniae-infected lungs but this is balanced by significantly higher rate of neutrophil survival and these two factors result in a net neutrophil level that is equivalent to or higher than that observed in WT mice .", "This result could arise because ROS production can increase myeloid cell death ( Coxon et al . , 1996; Geering and Simon , 2011; Geering et al . , 2011 ) , and thus , defects in ROS production by Skap2-/-\u00a0neutrophils could contribute to higher survival and accumulation in infected murine lungs .", "These possibilities are important to address with additional experiments , such as pulse-labelling newly differentiated neutrophils to track rates of migration during infection in vivo .", "Murine models of infection have been helpful in illuminating K . pneumoniae infection biology , however , there exist significant differences between mice and humans in the immune response to infection , including disparities in structural anatomy , circulating neutrophil counts , surface receptors , and signaling cascades , among others ( Mizgerd and Skerrett , 2008; Mestas and Hughes , 2004; Condliffe et al . , 2005; Hajjar et al . , 2010; Sun et al . , 2016; Bagaitkar et al . , 2012; Bengoechea and Sa Pessoa , 2019 ) .", "Thus , to date it is unknown if SKAP2 plays a role in mediating the\u00a0human neutrophil response to K . pneumoniae infection .", "Skap2 has 9 transcripts and at least 50 exonic variants that have been reported in the human population , however , their functional consequences , if any , remains unclear ( Cunningham et al . , 2019 ) .", "It would be interesting to explore if the SKAP2-mediated K . pneumoniae-stimulated responses occur in human neutrophils , and whether neutrophils ( or other cell types ) from individuals carrying specific Skap2 variants respond differently K . pneumoniae 43816 infection .", "In addition , it is unclear whether our results with K . pneumoniae 43816 will be found with other K2 strains or strains of other serotypes .", "Genome-wide analyses of K . pneumoniae clinical isolates have shown extensive genetic diversity , virulence factors , and pathogenicity ( Holt et al . , 2015; Deleo et al . , 2014; Agard et al . , 2019 ) .", "Furthermore , since neutrophils are not the major player in host defenses against all strains of K . pneumoniae , including some multi-drug resistant clinical isolates ( Xiong et al . , 2016; Xiong et al . , 2015; Broug-Holub et al . , 1997; Greenberger et al . , 1996 ) , future studies can use these K . pneumoniae strains to probe the role of SKAP2 in neutrophils as

infections to autoimmune diseases to cancer ( Hoffmann and Griffiths , 2018; Nguyen et al . , 2017 ) , and the crucial function of SKAP2-mediated ROS in murine neutrophils suggests that further
