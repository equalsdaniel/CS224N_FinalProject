by fundamental questions about the regulatory information encoded in 3\u2032 UTRs .", "Single-gene studies have made clear that , in addition to its interplay with exonic splicing [23] , [24] , RNA 3\u2032-end processing can dictate the extent of 3\u2032 UTR sequence incorporated into mature transcripts that governs half-life , translation , and localization [25]\u2013[29]; the efficiency of transcription termination itself can also influence steady-state expression level of a given length form [30]\u2013[34] .", "In general , however , identifying the regulatory elements that underlie relationships between 3\u2032 UTR sequence and gene expression remains a primary challenge , and for the majority of human genes , the regulatory impact of alternative polyadenylation is unknown .",

elements , and analysis strategies to integrate the data .", "Recently developed short-read sequencing methods for transcript ends [40]\u2013[46] have enabled the possibility of quantitative studies of the regulatory architecture of transcript end forms on a genomic scale .", "In this work , we set out to investigate mechanisms by which alternative polyadenylation impacts gene expression and its variation across genetically distinct human individuals .", "We used 3\u2032-end RNA-seq [42] to maximize the genomic coverage and precision of transcript end positions , and to measure quantitative expression levels of transcript forms .", "The results shed light on the architecture of transcript ends and regulatory elements in human 3\u2032 UTRs and the principles of genetic variation in 3\u2032 length form usage ."], ["To survey the 3\u2032 ends of transcripts in human B-lymphoblastoid cells , we isolated RNA from cell lines derived from six human individuals and subjected each replicate of each sample to 3\u2032-end RNA-seq , which sequences polyadenylated transcript ends on a genomic scale [42] with strong and significant reproducibility ( Figure S1 ) .", "Our analysis pipeline , described in Materials and Methods , filtered out likely products of mispriming from A-rich genomic regions [47] and categorized mapping reads in terms of well-defined peaks or dispersed regions of reads with no peak structure ( Table S1 ) .", "We considered the former to represent the strongest candidates for stable , functional transcript end forms , and focused on these for in-depth analysis , taking the last mapped base of each read as the likely site at which the nascent RNA was cleaved from the processing polymerase and polyadenylated [24] .", "Across such transcript ends mapping to nuclear-encoded loci , the vast majority of reads ( 87% ) originated from 3\u2032 UTRs of coding genes ( Figure 1A and Table S1 ) ; 80% of transcript ends were consistent with the 3\u2032 ends of previously annotated length forms ( Tables S1 and S2 and Figure S2 ) .", "Within 40 base pairs of the inferred cleavage position , most transcript end forms harbored a polyadenylation signal sequence: either the canonical A ( A/U ) UAAA [23] or a close variant , or an A-rich stretch [48]\u2013[50] ( Figure S3A ) .", "Reporter assays confirmed the regulatory importance of A-rich stretches upstream of the inferred cleavage positions in CPSF1 and WDR18 , whose 3\u2032 UTRs lacked canonical polyadenylation signal motifs ( Figure S3C ) .", "We set out to analyze our data set of 3\u2032 transcript ends with respect to alternative polyadenylation , focusing on a maximum of two abundant , distinguishable transcript forms in a given gene .", "We considered three patterns of transcript end usage [30]: class I , indicating genes with a single transcript form terminating in an annotated 3\u2032 UTR; class II , genes with alternative polyadenylation in the same annotated 3\u2032 UTR; and class III , genes in which the two alternative polyadenylation forms differed in their composition of coding sequence ( Figure 1B ) .", "We also observed a small fraction of genes with a single transcript form terminating inside annotated coding exons or introns ( Table S3 ) .", "The breakdown of transcript forms into these classes revealed alternative polyadenylation reaching our threshold of detection in \u223c30% of genes ( Figure 1B ) .", "Across these genes , we observed the expected enrichment of the A ( A/U ) UAAA polyadenylation signal motif in the distal relative to proximal polyadenylation signals ( Figure S3A ) , correlating with the higher expression levels of the long transcript forms [30] , [51] .", "The lower-abundance short transcript forms were more likely to harbor an A-rich stretch or no recognizable polyadenylation signal motif upstream of the inferred cleavage position ( Figure S3B ) , lending credence to the notion that the latter regions represent weak recognition sites for the 3\u2032-end processing machinery [48] .", "We sought to harness our data set of transcript ends to investigate regulatory elements governing translation and transcript half-life , and their relationship to alternative 3\u2032 transcript forms .", "For this purpose , we applied a motif-search strategy to identify putative microRNA binding sites , A/U rich elements ( AREs ) , G/U-rich elements , binding sites for the Pumilio family of proteins , and Alu transposable elements in 3\u2032 UTRs .", "We tabulated rates of sequence variation across human populations and observed marked conservation of most regulatory element motifs relative to the background level of 3\u2032 UTR polymorphism ( Figure 2A ) , reflecting a history of purifying selection on these putatively functional regulatory sequences [52]\u2013[54] .", "We expected that the regulatory logic of alternative polyadenylation would be intimately connected with sequence determinants of transcript half-life or translation in 3\u2032 UTRs .", "For a given gene subject to alternative polyadenylation , we referred to the region of the 3\u2032 UTR upstream of the proximal cleavage site as \u201cshared\u201d among the alternative polyadenylation length forms , and the span of the 3\u2032 UTR in between the proximal and distal cleavage sites as the \u201cdifferential\u201d region ( Figure 2B ) .", "We hypothesized that , if alternative polyadenylation often acted to tune the exposure of cis-regulatory motifs in 3\u2032 UTR sequences , these motifs would preferentially be positioned in differential regions .", "To test this , we tabulated the positions of each type of regulatory element across our set of alternatively polyadenylated genes in class II .", "Significance testing revealed a significant enrichment of genes with motifs in the differential regions of 3\u2032 UTRs relative to those with motifs in shared regions ( Figure 2C ) .", "Analyzing the annotations of genes in these sets , we observed a preponderance of genes with immune-related functions among those with cis-regulatory motifs in the differential regions of 3\u2032 UTRs , while motifs in shared regions of 3\u2032 UTRs were largely detected among genes with housekeeping roles ( Table S5 ) .", "Thus , for genes carrying out immune processes in B-lymphoblastoid cells , the choice between long and short transcript end forms often exposes or eliminates regulatory information in 3\u2032 UTRs , highlighting the importance of 3\u2032-end processing in the control of gene expression levels for specialized cell functions .", "To investigate the genetics of RNA 3\u2032-end processing , we first assessed the contribution of genetic differences , relative to experimental and environmental error , to variation of transcript 3\u2032-end positions across the six genotypes of lymphoblastoid cells in our study .", "For this purpose , we calculated the heritability of length form abundance for each gene , finding 194 coding genes at which the abundances of transcript length forms differed reproducibly ( heritability>0 . 6 ) across human samples ( Table S6 ) .", "To begin to dissect the molecular basis for natural genetic variation in 3\u2032-end usage at these loci , we considered the potential role for DNA sequence differences at polyadenylation signals , the primary determinants of transcript cleavage and polyadenylation .", "We reasoned that although such variants were rare in the human population ( Figure 2A ) , some could underlie differences between human individuals in 3\u2032-end length form usage .", "Consistent with this prediction , genes with highly heritable transcript end positions harbored a single nucleotide polymorphism in polyadenylation signal motif sequence much more often than did the average gene ( 2% of polyadenylation signals at genes with heritable transcript ends , compared to 0 . 3% genome-wide; Fisher's exact p\u200a=\u200a0 . 004; Table S6 ) .", "We hypothesized that naturally occurring genetic variation in RNA 3\u2032-end processing would prove to underlie changes across individuals in steady-state levels of gene expression .", "To test this , we analyzed the genomic relationship between biallelic single-nucleotide polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals and gene expression differences across our set of lymphoblastoid cell lines from distinct human genotypes .", "We used a standard regression test of genetic association to evaluate genotype at each such sequence variant as a predictor of expression of the gene in which it lay .", "The results revealed a significant enrichment of association with expression for variants in polyadenylation signals , relative to the background signal from 3\u2032 UTRs as a whole ( Figure 3A ) .", "We expected that for a given such variant , the allele conferring a closer match to the canonical polyadenylation signal motif would confer more robust transcription termination , and thus more abundant steady-state levels of transcription , than would the allele weakening the match to the canonical motif .", "To quantify this effect , we scored each allele in each variant polyadenylation signal with respect to agreement with the canonical motif , and at each variant position , we calculated the difference in scores between alleles .", "This score difference was a strong predictor of the effect of a given polyadenylation signal variant on steady-state expression levels ( Figure 3B ) , with a departure from the polyadenylation signal motif associated with a drop in expression as predicted .", "To pursue on a molecular basis the impact of variation across humans in polyadenylation signals , we used our 3\u2032-end RNA-seq data to infer the effects of single-nucleotide variants on usage of 3\u2032 transcript forms at individual genes , and we evaluated these predictions in single-gene 3\u2032 UTR reporter assays .", "For each gene , toggling natural variant alleles at one nucleotide position in the polyadenylation signal was sufficient to drive differential usage of short and long 3\u2032 transcript forms ( Figure 4 ) .", "These included variants attenuating usage of 3\u2032 forms of the translation initiation factor EIF2A and the putative DNA methylation enzyme DIP2B , as well as the expected effect of the polymorphic polyadenylation signal on usage of 3\u2032 forms of the inflammation regulator IRF5 [15] .", "In each of the latter genes , the causal variant conferred significant changes in luciferase protein levels as well as usage of transcript forms ( Figure 4A\u2013F ) .", "Our set of confirmed causal variants at polyadenylation signals also included that in the transcription factor NAB1 , which attenuated usage of a minor 3\u2032 transcript form with modest effect on luciferase levels ( Figure 4G , H ) .", "We conclude that sequence differences in polyadenylation signals represent a key mechanism underlying variation between humans in levels of gene expression , with genome-scale trends validated at the single-gene level .", "We next sought to dissect the mechanisms by which natural variation in 3\u2032-end usage impacted gene expression , using as case studies IRF5 and DIP2B , which lie in genomic regions associated with susceptibility to lupus [15] and colorectal cancer [55] , respectively , as well as NAB1 and EIF2A .", "In RNA expression measurements using the 3\u2032 UTR haplotype that produced both long and short transcript forms of a given gene , one form was detected at higher abundance in each case ( Figure 4B , D , F , H ) .", "We hypothesized that these abundance differences between length forms could be in part the result of sequence elements that dictate transcript cleavage , polyadenylation , and termination , and in part the result of regulatory elements that affect transcript half-life .", "To test this , for each gene we first developed expression reporters incorporating only the regions flanking the end positions of each transcript form in turn , which we expected would include the polyadenylation signal and auxiliary sequence motifs underlying 3\u2032-end processing of the respective form while excluding most other 3\u2032 regulatory information .", "Expression measurements confirmed differences in the strength of these 3\u2032-end processing motifs between length forms for EIF2A , IRF5 , and DIP2B , in that reporters incorporating each of the two 3\u2032-end sequences from a given gene exhibited up to 2 . 5-fold differences in expression ( Figure 5A , C , E ) .", "To assess the contribution of 3\u2032 regulatory elements that control transcript half-life , we next measured the decay rate of each transcript length form upon addition of actinomycin D in the context of complete 3\u2032 UTRs .", "Measurements of transcript stability by quantitative PCR and by Northern blot bore out this prediction , with the long transcript form showing reduced half-life relative to the short form for IRF5 [15] and DIP2B ( Figure 5D , F and Figure S4B , C ) , and increased half-life for NAB1 ( Figure 5H and Figure S4D ) .", "Analyzing these results together with the effects of natural variants in polyadenylation signals ( Figure 4 ) indicates that for a given gene , a variant can abrogate production of a transcript form with strong sequence determinants of 3\u2032-end processing , leaving only the less efficiently processed form and giving rise to lower total expression of the gene product , as in IRF5 and EIF2A .", "In addition , a variant abrogating production of a transcript form with longer half-life leaves only the less-stable form and reduces total steady-state levels of the gene product , as in IRF5 and DIP2B .", "As a further investigation of the determinants of abundance of long and short transcript forms for genes subject to natural genetic change in 3\u2032-end processing , we analyzed the role of 3\u2032 regulatory elements in such genes in relation to trans-acting regulatory factors .", "We identified a candidate ARE in the differential region of the 3\u2032 UTR of IRF5 , i . e . between the positions of alternative 3\u2032 ends observed in our 3\u2032-end RNA-seq; a candidate ARE in the differential region of NAB1; and a candidate binding site for the miRNA miR-101 in the differential region of DIP2B ( Figure 6 ) .", "To assess the functional relevance of these motifs , we applied a mutagenesis strategy using 3\u2032 UTR reporter constructs for each gene , as above distinguishing between the 3\u2032 UTR haplotype that produced both long and short transcript forms and the haplotype producing only the long form ( Figure 4D , F , H ) .", "For each inferred cis-regulatory element , we assayed the regulatory response of 3\u2032 UTR reporters to the trans-acting factor predicted to mediate its repressive effect: the ARE-binding proteins TTP and AUF1 for IRF5 and NAB1 , respectively , and a mimic of miR-101 for DIP2B .", "In each case , expression measurements from mutagenized reporter constructs established the respective sequence element as necessary for full repression of the long form of its host UTR ( Figure 6 ) , validating our motif inferences .", "Among experiments that used haplotypes producing both short and long 3\u2032 forms of the respective UTRs , motifs in the differential region were only necessary for repression by trans-acting factors in the case of NAB1 ( Figure 6C ) , for which the population of transcripts arising from this haplotype was dominated by the long form ( Figure 4H ) .", "Taken together , our results illustrate the complexity of regulatory information in 3\u2032 UTRs , as determinants of RNA 3\u2032-end processing and transcript fate each contribute to the final expression level of the host gene .", "We conclude that , for these case studies , integrating predicted regulatory motifs with knowledge of transcript end positions is essential in the effort to relate genotype to gene expression .", "We next aimed to shed light on the biological context in which differences in regulatory responsiveness could manifest between long and short transcript forms .", "For this purpose , we focused on natural variation in alternative polyadenylation at the immune regulator IRF5 .", "In response to the bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , immune genes undergo an immediate spike in expression , followed by dampening to a more modest steady-state level mediated by the ARE-binding protein TTP [56]\u2013[58] .", "Motivated by our discovery of a repressive ARE in the differential region of IRF5 ( Figure 6A ) , we hypothesized that the genetically determined production of long and short 3\u2032 mRNA forms of this gene would be associated with different patterns of regulatory behavior after induction .", "To test this , we treated B-lymphoblastoid cell lines from genetically distinct individuals with LPS and , in each culture , measured the recovery of expression levels of IRF5 transcript forms over time .", "The results , shown in Figure 7 , revealed , after an initial overshoot in expression , a difference of up to 2-fold in the time to reach steady-state expression between long and short mRNA forms , with the long form downregulated to steady-state more quickly after induction as predicted , given the presence of the repressive ARE in the latter transcript .", "Variation in IRF5 expression recovery across B-lymphoblastoid lines was associated with genotype at the proximal polyadenylation signal in the IRF5 3\u2032 UTR: haplotypes encoding the long form of IRF5 conferred rapid repression after induction ( Figure 7B ) relative to haplotypes encoding the short form ( Figure 7A ) .", "These findings suggest that genetic variation in 3\u2032-end processing dictates differences across individuals in the regulatory dynamics of IRF5 , further underscoring the power of our approach to identify biologically relevant regulatory effects of 3\u2032-end processing .", "Our molecular confirmation of cis-regulatory elements in 3\u2032 UTRs inferred from sequence search methods ( Figure 6 ) suggested that such inference could provide a mechanistic understanding of gene expression on a genomic scale .", "In particular , we expected that sequence variants between individuals in 3\u2032 regulatory elements would be significant predictors of variation in steady-state expression of the genes in which they lay .", "To test this notion , we first tabulated all single-nucleotide polymorphisms across the cell lines of our data set which overlapped with 3\u2032 regulatory motifs and Alu elements in 3\u2032 UTRs .", "We next classified these motifs according to the impact of alternative polyadenylation on their positions in 3\u2032 UTRs , and we used association tests to assess the strength of each motif variant in each class as a predictor of steady-state expression of its respective gene .", "The results ( Figure 8 ) revealed association with expression across human individuals , for variants in AREs , G/U-rich elements , Pumilio sites , and Alu elements .", "The relationship with expression was striking and significant for variants in regions of 3\u2032 UTRs constitutively incorporated into mature messages ( Figure 8 ) .", "Polymorphic motifs incorporated into low-abundance 3\u2032 length forms showed no evidence of association with expression changes in their respective genes , consistent with the minor contribution of these forms; by the same token , polymorphic motifs in regions incorporated into the predominant 3\u2032 length forms of mRNAs were more strongly associated with expression of their respective genes , though not significantly so ( Figure 8 ) .", "As expected [6] , the relationship between sequence variants and gene expression did not manifest for miRNA sites ( data not shown ) .", "These findings highlight the relevance of 3\u2032 regulatory motifs as predictors of expression variation across human individuals , when integrated with knowledge of transcript length forms from our sequencing strategy ."], ["Alternative polyadenylation is prevalent in the human transcriptome , and in landmark cases , variation across individuals in the use of 3\u2032 length forms of RNAs has been shown to underlie human disease [15]\u2013[20] .", "However , for most human genes , the regulatory importance of changes in transcript ends between individuals is incompletely understood , owing to the challenges of measuring 3\u2032-end usage and identifying functional regulatory elements in 3\u2032 UTRs .", "We have developed a spatially precise , quantitative , high-throughput sequencing approach for 3\u2032 ends , complementing now-classic studies of expressed sequence tags [30] , [36] , [48] , [51] , [59]\u2013[61] .", "We have used the resulting transcript end positions and abundances to pioneer an analysis approach which integrates bioinformatic predictions of 3\u2032 regulatory motifs , genomic analysis , and molecular genetics .", "With this strategy , we have established a regulatory map of transcript ends and functional elements in the 3\u2032 UTRs of lymphoblastoid cells , and we have abstracted genomic principles of alternative polyadenylation and natural genetic variation in this cell type .", "Our mapping of 3\u2032-end length forms and sequence motifs in 3\u2032 UTRs revealed an intuitive logic in which the choice between short and long UTR forms governs the incorporation of regulatory elements into mature messages [36] , [61] .", "We note that the 3\u2032 length forms we report in B-lymphoblastoid cells represent a subset of the total complement of 3\u2032 UTR lengths used across tissues .", "As such , we hypothesize that surveys of tissue types will ultimately reveal transcript forms of many genes , used in particular contexts , that incorporate 3\u2032 regulatory information to different extents .", "The ability to tune the responsiveness to trans-acting input itself distinguishes alternative polyadenylation from other transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms , providing a compelling model for the particular advantage of 3\u2032-end processing as a regulatory strategy and a rationale for its prevalence in mammalian genomes .", "In comparisons across cell lines from genetically distinct individuals , we analyzed the regulatory importance of genetic changes at 3\u2032 transcript ends .", "We uncovered a key role for polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals as a driver of changes in gene expression , and we detailed the molecular mechanisms at play .", "The polyadenylation variants we study here dictate the production of transcript forms with different determinants of 3\u2032-end processing , different half-lives , and different recognition sites for trans-acting regulators .", "These findings establish a connection between observational studies of transcript 3\u2032 length forms across human populations [21] , [22] and regulatory effects of this variation .", "In the case of IRF5 , we discovered that a naturally occurring genetic change in usage of 3\u2032 RNA forms can serve to tune the kinetics of recovery of expression after induction by lipopolysaccharide .", "Thus , against the backdrop of prior studies of this lupus susceptibility gene [15] , we have uncovered an additional dimension by which variation in RNA 3\u2032-end processing affects regulatory behavior .", "Given these case-study results as a validation of our genome-scale analyses , we speculate that many genetic variants with biologically relevant effects mediated by RNA 3\u2032-end processing remain to be discovered in the human population .", "We have also shown that polymorphisms in 3\u2032 motifs that govern transcript fate can serve as predictors of steady-state levels of the genes in which they lie .", "In light of the ultimate goal of predicting regulatory and phenotypic effects from human genome sequence , our results indicate that analysis strategies using sequence determinants of transcription initiation and splicing alone are likely to provide an incomplete model of expression variation .", "Importantly , however , our work makes clear that binding sites for regulators of mRNA localization , half-life , and translation at 3\u2032 ends are themselves only part of the regulatory landscape .", "Rather , a complete understanding of the genetics of gene expression will integrate the usage of RNA 3\u2032-end processing signals with the effects of 3\u2032 sequence elements that control transcript fate .", "We anticipate that abundances and positions of transcript ends observed in 3\u2032-end RNA-seq will prove to be a key component in the systems-level modeling of regulatory networks and their variation .", "In summary , while the genetic study of RNA 3\u2032-end processing is in its infancy , our work and that of others [15]\u2013[22] establishes that variation at 3\u2032 ends can be a critical determinant of regulatory behaviors .", "However , for the vast majority of human genes , the importance of 3\u2032 regulatory change remains unknown .", "Our single-gene experiments detail the expression effects of 3\u2032 UTR variation in the disease-associated genes IRF5 [15] and DIP2B [55]; the potential for regulatory variants as drivers of human disease will serve as continued motivation for genomic and genetic analyses of expression change ."], ["Two biological replicates of each of the human lymphoblastoid cell lines GM10860 , GM17106 , GM17189 , GM17207 , GM17220 , and GM17253 ( Coriell Institute ) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented

clusters spanned less than 24 bp , but if the polyA positions in a cluster spanned more than 40 bp , we applied a peak-finding algorithm as follows .", "For each genome coordinate in the region

highly mutable epitope of Tat SL8 [26] , and that ongoing sequence evolution occurs even in animals with undetectable plasma viremia .", "Moreover , we show that the observed sequence evolution can be characterized as viral epitope escape , a consequence of SIV-specific CD8 T cell pressure on the virus as indicated by the many nonsynonymous mutations that appear within mapped CD8 T cell epitopes

epitopes and the accumulation of CD8 T cell responses specific for these epitopes .", "In addition , escaped SIV-specific CD8 T cell responses are maintained as central memory CD8 T cells and , as such , contribute to the increased cumulative breadth of the CD8 T cell response at week 20 post-vaccination with SIV\u0394nef .", "Finally , epitope escape and the ensuing generation of de novo CD8 T cell responses to these escape variants constitute a deepening of the CD8 T cell repertoire .", "Our work sheds new light on SIV\u0394nef and other LASIV vaccines and how their functional and mechanistic characteristics are fundamentally different from other vaccines .", "While many of the recent successful replication competent virus vector-based vaccines such as CMV and RRV are also persistent [34\u201337] , we demonstrate that SIV\u0394nef is not only a persistent vaccine but that , as a lentivirus , it evolves with the immune response it induces and , ultimately , shapes the CD8 T cell response during the vaccination period .", "This unique characteristic of SIV\u0394nef to mutate allows for maturation of CTL specificity through increased targeting of conserved regions , deepening and broadening of the response .", "Furthermore , this new model accommodates earlier known properties of LASIV , such as the observation that the level of protection of LASIV vaccines inversely correlates with the level of attenuation of the vaccine [6 , 38] .", "Based on our current work , we hypothesize that LASIV vaccine efficacy depends on virus evolution , resulting in the concurrent CD8 T cell specificity shift from highly variable to conserved regions of the virus .", "Highly attenuated viruses , such as SIV\u03944 , which exhibits lower efficacy compared to SIV\u0394nef [38] , would have lower replication rates and less escape events , therefore less opportunity to shape the CD8 T cell response .", "Despite three decades of HIV research , basic questions of vaccine design remain hotly debated , namely the optimal balance of CD8 T cell response magnitude , breadth and specificity that should be induced by a vaccine .", "In suggesting that anentropic specificity is a more important correlate of protection in SIV\u0394nef-vaccinated animals than response magnitude , our data corroborates previous work on long-term nonprogressors ( LTNP ) , another important model of spontaneous lentiviral suppression .", "Research on LTNP has shown that MHC I molecules associated with protection restrict CD8 T cells that target regions within HIV Gag [39 , 40] as well as highly conserved epitopes [41] .", "However , unlike viral control in LTNP , which is associated with certain protective HLA molecules , we document increased targeting of highly conserved epitopes in all animals regardless of their MHC I genotypic background .", "Similar to our LASIV-induced protection , viral control in LTNP is correlated with the immunodominance of CD8 T cell responses that target highly conserved epitopes [42] , given that immunodominant CD8 T cells exert more immune pressure [41] .", "Finally , studies of LTNP revealed the importance of targeting conserved regions during acute infection [41] , before massive depletion of CD4 T cells has occurred [43] .", "Our research demonstrates that at week 20 , whereas responses to variable regions have waned , the immunodominant SIV-specific CD8 T cells target more conserved epitopes than at week 5 .", "The presence of immunodominant CD8 T cells exerting pressure on highly conserved regions during acute infection in animals challenged at week 20 post-vaccination , but not at week 5 , could explain the observed difference in protection .", "Conversely , the absence of immunodominant responses targeting highly conserved regions in animals challenged at week 5 allows the virus to easily escape and the accumulation of anentropic-specific CD8 T cell responses would occur long after acute infection , if at all .", "In addition to immunodominant SIV-specific CD8 T cells with anentropic specificity , we also show increased cumulative breadth and depth of the CD8 T cell response at week 20 compared to week 5 .", "The increased cumulative breadth at week 20 is a function of waning escaped CD8 T cell responses that are maintained as central memory CD8 T cells and are recalled upon challenge .", "It is unclear how effective these responses are at long-term viral suppression , given that they have been escaped and mostly target variable regions of the virus .", "Still , a recent report suggests that acute-phase SIV-specific CD8 T cells targeting variable regions are important for viral control [44] , indicating that the increased cumulative breadth of the CD8 T cell response at week 20 may also contribute to protection .", "Moreover , we detected de novo CD8 T cell responses specific to escaped epitope variants , illustrating that viral escape also contributes to increased immune response depth .", "Although LTNP generate HIV-specific CD8 T cells that cross-react with escape mutants [45] , the generation of de novo CD8 T cell responses to escaped epitopes is rarely observed in adults infected with HIV [46] .", "In animal 256\u201300 , we identified two such CD8 T cell responses that target variant epitopes at week 38 but were not detectable at week 5 .", "We only assayed CD8 T cell responses against escape variants of known CD8 T cell epitopes with known MHC I restriction , and only if the MHC I is expressed by the infected animal .", "The relative frequency of de novo CD8 T cell responses in SIV\u0394nef-vaccinated animals , if verified in future studies , could be due to an intact CD4 T cell compartment that persists well into the chronic phase of LASIV infection .", "Previous reports have documented rapid escape of variable epitopes during acute HIV-1 infection and maintenance of CD8 T cell responses specific for conserved epitopes into chronic infection [47\u201349] .", "Here , in the context of SIV\u0394nef , we demonstrate , in addition to rapid escape of variable epitopes and maintenance of existing CD8 T cell responses with anentropic specificity , de novo CD8 T cell responses against novel epitopes and escape variants during chronic infection .", "Furthermore , we correlate the accumulation of CD8 T cell responses with anentropic specificity and the increased repertoire depth and breadth to the kinetics of SIV\u0394nef vaccine-induced protection .", "Previous research on the coevolution of lentiviral epitopes and the CD8 T cell response has been conducted in the setting of wild-type infection , and it is unclear that our findings of increased anentropic specificity , cumulative breadth and repertoire depth during SIV\u0394nef vaccination would apply to wild-type lentiviral infection , in which the CD8 T cell response is likely to be impaired by the persistently high antigenic load , CD4 T cell depletion in the gut and microbial translocation-induced immune activation .", "Notably , we did not see an increased magnitude of the SIV-specific CD8 T cell response in the lymph nodes between weeks 5 and 20 .", "Fukazawa and colleagues [6] have recently shown that less attenuated LASIVs such as SIV\u0394nef have higher viral replication in the lymph nodes and , in turn , have higher lymph node CD8 T cell responses .", "Although these results corroborate existing data demonstrating that protection inversely correlates with LASIV attenuation [38] , our data demonstrates that the magnitude of the CD8 T cell response does not correlate with the kinetics of protection , neither in the PBMC nor lymph node compartment .", "Although our current work supports the importance of conserved responses as a correlate for protection , others have shown that using conserved regions as immunogens may result in a reduction of the total magnitude of responses [50] .", "It is unknown whether vaccines inducing targeted responses toward conserved regions will make up for the loss of magnitude .", "Still it is encouraging that we observe increased anentropic specificity in all animals , suggesting that even nonprotective MHC I molecules can target highly conserved epitopes if properly primed .", "It has also been proposed that the increased protection of LASIV vaccines is due to phenotypic maturation of the CD8 T cell response .", "It is important to delineate whether observed phenotypic changes in SIV-specific CD8 T cells correlate with LASIV protection and whether CD8 T cell phenotypic maturation is specific to LASIV or can be seen in other vaccines , such as adenovirus- , CMV- and RRV-based SIV vaccines .", "Finally , although this data set was focused on the CD8 T cell response and its evolution over time post-vaccination , we observed relatively few nonsynonymous mutations in env outside of mapped CD8 T cell epitopes , suggesting that antibody responses induced only modest immune selective pressure on SIV\u0394nef compared to CD8 T cell responses .", "Although immunodominance , specificity , breadth and depth have been implicated for some time as determinants of a successful CD8 T cell response against HIV/SIV infection , these results demonstrate how such a CD8 T cell response may be induced by the highly protective SIV\u0394nef vaccine .", "This new model of SIV\u0394nef-mediated protection raises obvious implications for vaccine design , namely that a successful vaccine should focus CD8 T cell responses on conserved regions of the virus and their existing variants .", "The recent success of viral vectors such as CMV [34\u201336] , RRV [37] , and adenovirus [51] to elicit potent CD8 T cell responses that partially protect rhesus macaques from infection has been an important step forward in vaccine design .", "However , these vaccines are all derived from DNA viruses , which have significantly lower rates of mutation than lentiviruses , and thus they are unlikely to shape the immune response in a similar fashion to SIV\u0394nef .", "Our work suggests that immunogens should be carefully chosen for these vectors such that the induced

infiltration of neutrophils to the site of infection is a hallmark of the inflammatory response to OPC and critical for the confinement of the fungus in the mucosal epithelium [6] .", "The neutrophil response in the oral mucosa was originally thought to be controlled by the IL-17 pathway , which itself is highly critical for fungal control during OPC [14] .", "However , previous work from our laboratory showed that the key protective function of IL-17 is uncoupled from the neutrophil response [6] .", "Although IL-17 signaling can enhance the expression of neutrophil chemokines and granulopoietic factors [14] , IL-17 is not required for neutrophil chemotaxis and function during OPC [6] .", "Instead , neutrophil trafficking to the oral mucosa during acute infection is under the control of IL-1R signaling as our data demonstrate .", "IL-1R deficiency is associated with impaired neutrophil recruitment and defective fungal control in response to OPC .", "Our data are consistent with previous reports demonstrating a role for IL-1R signaling in antifungal defense in different settings including systemic candidiasis [24] , a model of mixed oral and systemic candidiasis [34] , A

stage in the coordination of the IL-1-mediated neutrophil response during OPC .", "They act as the major producers of neutrophil-recruiting chemokines .", "Chemokine production by keratinocytes was greatly enhanced by IL-1R signaling and at least in part through the autocrine activity of IL-1\u03b1 .", "A similar mechanism for enhanced chemokine secretion by keratinocytes was described before in the context of Staphylococcus aureus skin infection [37] .", "A second mechanism , by which keratinocytes promote the neutrophil response during OPC , is by the induction of G-CSF via their capacity to produce IL-1\u03b1 .", "Our data thus link IL-1 signaling and G-CSF production .", "G-CSF regulates granulopoiesis and neutrophil mobilization in the bone marrow , which is critical to meet the rapidly increasing demand of neutrophils in the infected tissue .", "Administration of recombinant G-CSF in mice is sufficient to drive emergency granulopoiesis as we and others have shown [38] , and

its delivery to the distant bone marrow and the induction of a systemic response .", "During systemic bacterial infections , G-CSF production by the endothelium was shown to be a direct and TLR4-dependent response of the vasculature to endotoxin stimulation which lead to the induction of emergency granulopoiesis [38] .", "During OPC , we found no evidence for direct response of the endothelium to C . albicans , and endothelial cells were not activated by the fungus in vitro .", "Instead , G-CSF was produced as a result of an IL-1-dependent crosstalk between keratinocytes and endothelial cells .", "IL-1\u03b1 was critical for the secretion of G-CSF into the circulation during OPC , and it was sufficient for stimulating G-CSF production by endothelial cells in culture ,

mucosa during infection .", "Consistent with the notion that murine keratinocytes are unable to produce IL-1\u03b2 [28] , we found this cytokine to be expressed by the hematopoietic compartment .", "IL-1\u03b2 induction in response to C . albicans was shown previously to depend on the NLRP3 inflammasome in different infection models [21 , 34 , 45] and NLRP3 was required in the hematopoietic compartment [29] .", "In addition to the NLRP3 inflammasome , the NLRC4 inflammasome was also shown to contribute to protection from OPC [29] .", "Whether its function at the level of the mucosal stroma is linked to the IL-1 pathway and whether it is involved in IL-1\u03b1 production in keratinocytes was not addressed .", "We found that the overall IL-1\u03b1 response resulted from the release

harboring a Gba missense mutation combined with prosaposin- or saposin C-deficient mice , another neuronopathic GD model , also show neuronopathic abnormalities[29 , 34] and have the advantage of longer survival than K14-lnl/lnl mice .", "However , the relevance of these mice to neuronopathic GD is controversial .", "The present study revealed that GBA-/- medaka survive long enough for

model .", "Firstly , the skin of GBA-/- medaka looks intact whereas severe skin lesion is observed in patients with perinatal lethal type GD and Gba null mice[4 , 43] .", "Secondly , GBA-/- medaka exhibited PAS-positive abnormal cells in spleen and kidney which presumably correspond to human Gaucher cells .", "In patients with GD , Gaucher cells are not found in kidney , but in liver , spleen

of GFAP-positive radial glial cells was not observed in GBA-/- medaka whereas astrogliosis is observed in humans and mice with neuronopathic GD .", "It was reported that the reaction of GFAP-positive radial glial cells to inflammation is different from that of mammalian astrocytes[31] .", "Lysosomes play a fundamental role in the autophagic pathway by fusing with autophagosomes and digesting their contents[45] .", "In general , lysosomal dysfunction results in defective digestion and accumulation of autophagic substrates such as polyubiquitinated proteins , p62 , and dysfunctional mitochondria , accompanied by accumulation of autophagosomes .", "Axonal swellings containing autophagosome-like structures are observed in mouse models of lysosomal storage diseases such as neuronopathic GD mice , Niemann-pick type C1 mice , Cathepsin D-deficient mice , and Cathepsin B/L double-deficient mice[34 , 46 , 47] .", "A previous study reported that autophagosomes are formed in the distal part of the axon and undergo retrograde transport toward the cell body[48] .", "Another previous study demonstrated that inhibition of lysosomal function in primary neurons from mouse embryos disrupts the axonal transport of autophagosomes and causes their accumulation in axons[49] .", "Considering these lines of evidence , we propose that GCase deficiency primarily causes lysosomal dysfunction , leading to disrupted retrograde transport of autophagosomes in axons and formation of axonal swellings with \u03b1-syn accumulation ( Fig . 6 ) .", "Contrary to our expectations , p62-positive aggregates did not colocalize with LC3- and \u03b1-syn-positive axonal swellings , but were mainly located in the perikarya of neurons .", "These results suggest the possibility that presynaptic \u03b1-syn is transported proximally and degraded in a p62-independent autophagy-lysosome pathway .", "A previous study supports this hypothesis .", "Conditional knockout mice lacking ATG7 in TH-positive neurons show \u03b1-syn aggregates in swollen axons in the striatum , but not in cell bodies in the midbrain , indicating that autophagic dysfunction initially causes \u03b1-syn aggregates in the distal part of axons[50] .", "In addition , another previous study demonstrated that \u03b1-syn aggregation occurs earlier in axons than in neuronal cell bodies in the cardiac sympathetic nervous system in PD patients[51] .", "Because axonal retrograde transport may be involved in the degradative pathway of \u03b1-syn and may be a therapeutic target in PD , further studies are required to elucidate the precise mechanisms .", "Because GBA+/- medaka as old as 12 months did not show any apparent abnormal phenotypes , we could not directly investigate how heterozygous GBA mutations cause PD .", "Meanwhile , according to a recent report , induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons from PD patients carrying heterozygous GBA mutations show \u03b1-syn accumulation , an impaired autophagy-lysosome pathway , and dysregulation of calcium homeostasis[12] .", "The reason for differences in phenotypes between in vivo and in vitro models is unclear .", "However , our findings from GBA+/- medaka seem to be reasonable because the penetrance of PD in GBA mutation carriers is estimated to be at most 30% by the age of 80 years[52] .", "Thus , second hits such as environmental factors and other genetic factors are probably required for the development of PD pathology in vivo .", "Cellular and animal PD models overexpressing \u03b1-syn have provided evidence for the various potential toxic mechanisms of \u03b1-syn .", "However , few studies have demonstrated the pathological role of endogenous \u03b1-syn in vivo , which may reflect the authentic role for \u03b1-syn in PD .", "A previous study showed that \u03b1-syn null mice are resistant to 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1 , 2 , 3 , 6-tetrahydropyridine ( MPTP ) toxicity compared with wild-type mice[53] .", "However , it is unclear whether this improvement is due to attenuation of \u03b1-syn toxicity or \u03b1-syn-mediated changes in the presynaptic machinery .", "Another previous study showed that the formation of intraneuronal inclusions and neurodegeneration in 26S proteasome-depleted mice is independent of \u03b1-syn[54] .", "In the present study , disruption of \u03b1-syn did not improve the life span , neuronal loss , or neuroinflammation in GBA-/- medaka .", "Moreover , \u03b1-syn was not involved in the accumulation of autophagosomes in axons .", "Our data indicate that \u03b1-syn accumulation is
