2010 ) , non-human primates ( Drucker and Brannon , 2014 ) , and even birds ( Rugani et al . , 2015 ) , suggesting a deep evolutionary heritage of the mental number line , although there is evidence that it can be influenced by cultural practice ( Shaki and Fischer , 2008 ) .", "Number-space interactions are attributed to the fact that the neural bases of numerical and space processing both localize to parietal cortex ( Hubbard et al . , 2005 ) , as evidenced by the fact that parietal lesions disrupt both numerical and spatial processing ( Zorzi et al . , 2002 ) .", "It has been suggested that this co-localization is the result of \u2018cortical recycling\u2019 during evolution or normal development ( Anderson , 2010; Dehaene and Cohen , 2007 ) , i . e . , numerical cognition builds upon circuits that originally process space , because the computations that are used to gauge target coordinates or to transform reference frames can also be used for operations on numbers .", "But to what extent do such recycled circuits retain their original functionality ?", "Does numerosity replace space , or does it augment it , allowing for shared computations across domains ?", "We describe a new phenomenon in which visual motion direction , a spatial dimension ubiquitous in dorsal stream areas , adapts numerosity , giving rise to a repulsive aftereffect: motion to the left adapts small numbers , leading to overestimation of numerosity , while motion to the right adapts large numbers , resulting in underestimation .", "Thus , motion can literally move us up and down the mental number line .", "This indicates that numerosity coopts circuits encoding space .", "Furthermore , we show that the reference frame of this cross-adaptation effect is spatiotopic , not retinotopic , which , together with the tuning profile of the adaptation effect , indicates that motion direction-numerosity cross-adaptation may occur in a homolog of area LIP .", "Thus , recycled numerosity processing circuits indeed remain sensitive to purely spatial features .", "This shows that \u2018cortical recycling\u2019 augments but does not obliterate the spatial capacities of parietal circuits ."], ["A second characteristic of the neural circuitry in the IPS is that it serves to convert retinotopic coordinates prevalent in early visual areas into eye- , head- , and

"However , the two areas can be distinguished based on their respective receptive field properties: while neurons in area LIP have spatially restricted receptive fields , each covering only a portion of the visual world , number-sensitive neurons in area VIP , the next stage of number processing , respond to stimuli distributed over the entire visual field ( Nieder and Dehaene , 2009 ) .", "We capitalized on these distinct properties of LIP and VIP and tested in Experiment 6 whether the cross-adaptation effect between motion direction and number occurs in a retinotopic ( early visual areas ) or spatiotopic ( IPS ) frame of reference , and whether it is spatially specific ( LIP ) or occurs over the entire visual field ( VIP ) , thus allowing us to infer the cortical area in which motion and number processing interact .", "To this end , in Experiment 6 we replicated Experiment 1 but now also manipulated the location of the test/probe stimuli on the screen relative to subjects\u2019 gaze ( Figure 4 ) : Subjects made two saccades between the adaptor and the test/probe stimuli .", "The second saccade would either bring their gaze back to the initial fixation location ( Figure 4a

on the screen as the adaptor ( Figure 4b ) , at the same location as the adapter relative to the subject\u2019s current gaze ( Figure 4c ) , or at a new location ( Figure 4d ) .", "This allowed us to compare two frames of reference and the spatial specificity of the cross-adaptation effect .", "If the cross-adaptation effect was present only when subjects looked at a new location on the screen but the stimuli were presented at the same position relative to their current center of gaze ( Figure 4c ) , it must take place in areas with a retinotopic frame of reference , i . e . , early visual areas; if cross-adaptation was evident only when subjects fixated at a new location but the stimuli were presented at the original location on the screen ( Figure 4b ) , it must occur in an area with a spatiotopic frame of reference and with restricted receptive fields , such as LIP; and if it occurred when subjects looked at the original fixation spot but stimuli were presented at a location that neither matched retino- nor spatiotopic reference frames ( Figure 4d ) , the area in which cross-adaptation takes place must support effects across the entire visual field , as would be predicted for VIP .", "Figure 5 shows that cross-adaptation between motion direction and number occurs even in the presence of two intervening saccades , replicating Experiment 1 .", "More importantly , the results of Experiment 6 show that cross-adaptation takes place in a spatiotopic , not retinotopic frame of reference , but is restricted to the spatiotopic location of the stimulus and does not extend over
